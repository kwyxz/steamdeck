      <systemDescription>NEC PC-9801 - a not quite industry standard PC line of personal computers developed in 1982 in Japan by NEC Corporation based on IBM solutions, aimed exclusively at the Japanese market.

The first model was a 16-bit architecture with an Intel 8086 processor clocked at 5 MHz and 128 KB of RAM. It shipped with graphics cards capable of displaying 8 colors at 640x400 resolution - a clear performance differentiator compared to PCs of the time.

Initially conceived as a solution for industrial and office applications, by 1987 the PC-9801 series captured nearly 90% of the Japanese personal computer market. Over time, as power increased and graphics and sound effects were appreciated by home users (especially gamers), it also became popular for non-commercial applications - the Touhou Project series, for example, made its debut.</systemDescription>
