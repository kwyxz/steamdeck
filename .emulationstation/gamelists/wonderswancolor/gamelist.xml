		<name>Arc the Lad: Kijin Fukkatsu</name>
		<desc>Two generations ago, there was a great battle between the humans and the machines. Led by their evil god, the machines were eventually able to win the battle and to take control over the world. You play the role of Elc, the hero of  Arc the Lad 2. As always, Elc is a freelance mercenary who gets assignments from his guild. He encounters Finia, a girl who belonged to a resistance group and whose mother was killed by the machines. With the help of other friends, the heroes must save the humanity and restore the world to normal.

This is a side-story in Arc the Lad series, set in a futuristic environment. As in the classic Arc the Lad games, the entire dungeon navigation is perceived as a series of continuous battles. You move your heroes in turn-based mode, and enemies use their turn to perform their moves. You can attack once an enemy is on a square near you, and also use a variety of special techniques.</desc>

		<name>Blue Wing Blitz</name>
		<desc>There are six nations living in the world of floating islands. The most powerful one is the Ordia Empire, possessing the best aircrafts in the world. But its leaders were hungry for even more power, and planned to invade and to occupy the other five nations. The other nations tried to maintain diplomatic relationship with the Empire as long as possible. But one of those countries, the Esk Republic, decided to send a special strike team of skillful pilots, attempting to initiate a secret rebellion against the Empire. A young pilot named Keid, guided by his senior partner, the girl Payer, is the one who was chosen for this mission.

"Blue Wing Blitz" is a turn-based strategy RPG with a twist: instead of fighters or soldier units, you command aircrafts. You navigate your planes over a battle field, which consists of airspaces, in round-based fashion. Once you land on a space occupied by an enemy plane, a battle follows. During those battles you have control over your aircraft, performing various attacks or defending. After several turns, the battle stops, but will resume if the enemy planes are still standing on the same space.</desc>

		<desc>This is a sequel to  Digimon Adventure 02: Tag Tamers, set in the world of digital monsters based on the popular manga series. After having defeated the evil Millenniumon, our hero Ryou thought that would be his last travel to the Digiworld. However, the four sacred Digimons summon him once again, to participate in the D1 monster fighting tournament. But that is not all: it appears that Millenniumon is still alive, and is looking for revenge! Now Ryou has to win the tournament and defeat his archenemy once again.

The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the previous game. You travel through top-down and isometric locations, fighting monsters with your own monster team, and then recruiting new monsters and assembling a collection. The battles are turn-based and are viewed from an isometric perspective. The monsters have various kinds of attacks in their disposal. Each attack is shown as a short animated sequence.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the popular Digimon manga, this is a sequel to  Digimon Adventure 02: D1 Tamers. The game picks up directly where the previous one ended. After yet another ultimate battle against the evil Millenniumon, during which he revealed to the hero Ryou a terrifying secret, there was a great explosion. Ryou comes to his senses in an unknown place. The only digital monster there explains to him that the explosion send Millenniumon to the future, while Ryou ended up in the past. And now Millenniumon is trying to take control over the main computer in the Digiworld, and it is Ryou's task to stop him once and for all, and to finally find the truth about his and his archenemy's identities.

The gameplay is similar to that of the predecessors: you navigate your hero over the top-down view, descend into dungeons, fight monsters in turn-based combat, recruit them into your party, and send the new teams to fight new enemies. The battle are not isometric any more, but viewed entirely as animé-style pictures. Attacks are also depicted as animated sequences.</desc>

		<name>Digimon Tamers: Digimon Medley</name>
		<desc>"Digimon Medley" is based on the popular manga and and animé series Digimon, in which ordinary Japanese children find a way into a digital world, where they help good digital monsters fight against evil ones. The game is not directly plot-related to  Digimon Adventure or Digimon Tamers: Brave Tamer games. Instead, it follows more closely the actual episodes of the series. You play as various characters, such as the main hero Taichi and his friend Yamato from the first episodes, as well as heroes from the Digimon Tamers sub-series: Takato, Ruki, and Lee. The game is divided into short episodes, each one of which revives one of the battles in the series. You start with Digimon Tamers, as they venture into the DigiWorld, only to meet the enigmatic digimon named Impmon, who is up to some mischief. 

Each episode can be played as one of several available characters. Each character also has his/her own digimon who fights all the battles. The battles are random and occur while you are navigating your heroes through top-down dungeons. The attacks are displayed as short animé-style sequences. During your turn, you must press the A button repeatedly to increase the power of your attack. The enemy attacks simultaneously, and you have to invest enough power in your attack in order for it to connect.</desc>

The hamster has its own room in a house, with a table and a wheel. There are many things you can do with the hamster. You can take in to a stroll in the forest, go shopping with it, make it play with a ball, and so on. You can also perform actions unrelated to the hamster, like re-decorating the house or writing and painting on a piece of paper. The game features a point-and-click interface: you move your cursor over an object (such as hamster or calendar), which brings up an action menu.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy IV</name>
		<desc>This is the fourth entry in the Final Fantasy series. It was known as Final Fantasy II internationally, because the second and third games were never released outside of Japan.

The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...

This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the first and the third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.

The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</desc>

		<name>Guilty Gear Petit</name>
		<desc>The game takes place in 22th century. Scientists developed a new technique that allowed them to merge the DNA of humans and animals, producing powerful creatures known as "gears". The characters of the game participate in a tournament, the winner of which would face a gear who went out of control and is threatening to lead a gear rebellion against the humans. The game allows you to play as familiar characters from Guilty Gear series, such as the main hero Sol Badguy, who has a certain connection to the gears, and his rival, the leader of the Holy Knights named Ky Kiske. It also introduces a new character, the nurse Fanny, who fights with a syringe and has a mysterious connection to the genius surgeon, and later serial murderer, Dr. Baldhead. 

"Guilty Gear Petit" is a 2D fighting game. The story mode lets you pick a character and take him/her through a series of fights, while in time attack mode you can choose your opponents freely. The graphics are done in "super-deformed" style. The game retains key ingredients of Guilty Gear gameplay, such as building tension in order to execute powerful attacks, combo moves, etc.</desc>

		<name>Guilty Gear Petit 2</name>
		<desc>In 22th century, scientists found a way to create artificial beings whom they called "gears". These gears were very powerful, but did not have wills of their own, and were completely obedient to the humans. However, a gear named Justice was able to free himself from the control and led a rebellion against the humans. Since then, the humanity lived in fear that the gears will one day gain the power on the Earth. For that purpose, the Sacred Order of the Holy Knights organized fighting tournaments to find out who is strong enough to face the renegade gears.

"Guilty Gear Petit 2" is very similar to its  predecessor, having the same "super-deformed" graphical style, battle moves (including the tension system to accumulate power and combo attacks), as well as backgrounds for battles. Several new characters appear in "Guilty Gear Petit 2", such as Zato-1, the former head of the assassin guild, the pirate captain Johnny, the time traveler Axl Lou from the 20th century, the mysterious Faust, and others.</desc>

In addition to earning points for completing a line across the field you will now earn points if those lines are of a matching color. Previously only gray lines were possible now red, blue, and green lines appear.

Gunpey EX has the same modes as the previous game, except a story mode. Time Attack mode where one has to eliminate as many tiles as possible in two of five minutes. Endless mode give the player unlimited time to crank out whatever score they desire. Stage mode presents a set number of tiles to remove in a given time. Puzzle mode puts the player in the situation of having to remove a certain group of tiles, the player can change the color of the lines here when they swap their tiles positions.

A link mode is available to play against another human with a WonderSwan and Gunpey EX. 

This game could access the internet through a wireless phone and the WonderGate where it was able to interact with an online high score board.</desc>

		<desc>Hanjuku Eiyu is set in a semi-comical universe called the Egg World, populated by two nations: Hanjuku and Kanjuku, or soft-boiled and hard-boiled eggs, respectively. You take the role of the commander of the Hanjuku army, and your goal is to guide it successfully through a series of events (called "tales"), capturing enemy castles and defeating the bosses of the Kanjuku army. 

This is a real-time war strategy game. The game time is divided into months, each month taking a few minutes of real time. You control the hero and his generals, each one commanding units of foot soldiers. You send your army commanders through the world map to capture enemy castles. Once all the castles are captured, a new construction appears on the map, where the level boss resides, and your final goal in the chapter (tale) is to defeat this boss. Once you run into an enemy, an automatic battle sequence occurs, which you can interrupt, assigning commands to your army. Both Hanjuku and Kanjuku armies can summon powerful creatures called Egg Monsters, who can fight against a whole army or against each other in turn-based combat. Each month a "monthly event" occurs, such as changes in the land, earthquake, etc. Random events also pop out, during which you can buy supplies for your army.</desc>

		<name>Inuyasha - Kagome No Sengoku Nikki</name>
		<desc>Inuyasha: Kagome no Sengoku Nikki is a "Fureai Adventure" where the player becomes the heroine Kagome Higurashi and communicates with Inuyasha. The story of Inuyasha changes depending on how the players interact.

The game is divided into the ?Inuyasha Forest? part that contacts with Inuyasha using commands such as ?Item? and ?Topic?, and the ?Search? part that advances the story while adventuring with friends. If you do many events that occur in the ?Exploration? part, the topics and items in the ?Inuyasha Forest? part will increase, and the interaction with Inuyasha will become even more fulfilling.

In addition, since the clock is built in the cassette, the game progresses in real time while linking with the actual time. Of course, many famous scenes of the original are recorded during the game, and familiar characters and enemy monsters appear.

There are many original episodes such as the appearance of the original character ?Itachi no Shippu? as a rival to Inuyasha. You can also review stories in the ?Album Diary? and enjoy mini-games such as ?Hide and Seek?.</desc>

		<desc>The third Inuyasha game Kagome no Yume Nikki is a sequel to the first Kagome no Sengoku Nikki. As you can see from the word ?Yume? in the title, ?Dream? is an important factor in this ?Dream Diary?.

The basic system of the game is the same as Sengoku Nikki, and the story is advanced while repeating the "contact part" and "adventure part", but this time a "dream event" occurs at the end of the day.

In "Dream Event", you can see situations that cannot be seen in anime and manga, as well as modern events that were requested in the previous work. This time, the enemy is also named after the dream. The enemy this time is an original character called Yakumo, a half-witch who manipulates dreams, and a battle in the dream world will be unfolded.

The game has a lot of original scenes, and the total number of events is 2.5 times higher than the previous work Sengoku Nikki.</desc>

The protagonist in this mystery story is none other than Holmes, the cat, not Sherlock, who got involved in a murder incident in an old castle somewhere in southern part of Germany, which is nowadays used as a sightseeing hotel. Ancient legends about witches, demons and strange phenomena are well known in the area, which adds a touch of supernatural to be feared of, if any of it true.

This game is made to play as a sound comic, meaning the artwork is made as an interactive comic book which progresses the story, yet allowing the player to enter choices which will take the story in a different direction and lead to one of several different endings.</desc>

		<desc>Namco Super Wars is a tactical role-playing game developed by Namco and published by Bandai for the Wonderswan Color. It is a crossover game, featuring characters from several classic Namco titles.

The game is played on a square grid, on which both the player's and computer's units are placed. Each side takes turns moving and making actions with their units. Every character has a variety of attacks and special moves that can be selected when performing an action. Some of these consume Spirit Points, which slowly regenerate each turn. The game is divided into stages. Between each stage, the player is able to visit a shop and prepare his units before starting the next stage. Unlike most RPGs, characters do not gain levels for directly defeating opponents. Instead, completion of a map will reward the players with a number of level ups, which they can then distribute among their units as they wish.</desc>

		<desc>You play as the rhyme rider Kerorcian, a vivacious space girl with a large frog helmet, as she skips to the music through the games four stages. The games music is largely comprised of jazzy techno pieces.

Kerorcian skips down a set line while randomly placed enemies and obstacles appear before her. Various button combos will avoid certain obstacles, although a "one-button" easy mode is available. When you avoid an obstacle a note will sound, clearing long chains of obstacles will result in funky melodies popping up inside the song that is playing. This gameplay is reminiscent of the studios earlier game Vib Ribbon.  

Some of the obstacles are interactive, such as a rocket one can jump on and ride a short distance, others can merely be kicked out of the way or jumped over.

Occasionally a crown will appear over an obstacle, if you successfully clear it you will briefly soar over the stage avoiding anything that might have been in your path. This is especially common before obstacles that might require outlandish button combos.</desc>

		<name>Romancing Sa-Ga</name>
		<desc>Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against the holy gods, and the holy God-Father chose a human warrior to help them. Finally, after a prolonged, terrible war, the leader of the three evil gods - Death, the eldest of them - surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, became a human and has lost her powers. The middle one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. Now, after thousand years have passed, and the seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, the hero of the new generation, to defeat him.

Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games with several main heroes. It is the first of three Super Nintendo entries. The first three games in the series were on the Gameboy and were known as "Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this game, you play the stories of eight characters, which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. The eight characters belong to different classes and have different abilities. There are four male characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from Final Fantasy II on the NES, instead of "Leveling" your character as a whole you level specific abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as well as, stats such as HP and Strength and Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb appears over the characters head and the new ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs are alike. Which is good considering the steep learning curve of the SaGa games which require multiple playthroughs to truly master the system.

"Romancing SaGa" was never released outside of Japan until the Playstation 2 remake "Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song"</desc>

The year is 2052. The world has established a new order centered on the two major camps, the Space Development Organization ?Jesus? and the International Civil Organization ?Green Frontier?. The two major organizations that were born as a result of repeated mergers by large corporations around the world will eventually become more tense over space development initiatives. And, with the surprise attack on the side of Jesus, the two camps finally enter the battle!

The player chooses and plays either pilot Kazuhito Moriguchi (boarding machine RUN = DIM) or Kanna Aso (boarding machine I = RA) belonging to the Green Frontier camp. The game consists of 6 stages.</desc>

The protagonist is selectable by the player at the beginning of the game, either the boy or the girl depicted on the front cover, together with some input such as the name, date of birth, and a blood type. The story starts with the player character about to become the new village chief. The ceremony gets interrupted by a bunch of attacking monsters and the hero barely escapes with their life.

The game uses a 3/4 view where the player moves in a vertical and horizontal way, can interact with other NPCs and fight enemies on the screen using projectiles or blunt weapons. Fighting is done in real-time, and after battling many weaker enemies, one will usually face a boss. While the player starts the game alone, they will get a pet companion, choosable out of four different types, in the middle of the journey. Leveling up is not done through gaining experience from combat, but instead by finding fairies scattered around the land.</desc>

The game is based entirely on quests which are not connected by a story arc. You play a nameless character with no background and there is no plot information or development beside your own progress with the quests. The gameplay consists entirely of playing cards. In the beginning of the game, an enigmatic woman named Maria asks you a series of questions, to determine the cards you get. After that, your character begins an adventure in a town. Locations, other characters, inventory, your movement - everything appears in form of cards. To get quests, you must choose your correspondent cards when encountering different people. You can buy weapons and equipment, and also fight enemies in turn-based combat by choosing the cards from your deck. You gain levels and become stronger in a traditional RPG fashion.</desc>

		<desc>In the future, many military forces are dependent on huge mech robots, called Wanzers (Walking Panzers) for combat. At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the "Larcus Incident" and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. 

One year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed "Carrion Crow". Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.

Front Mission is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a seperate unit and, has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped. Units get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques. The more an attack is used, the more powerful it becomes.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy</name>
		<desc>Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy... the first of one of the longest role-playing game series known to mankind. Final Fantasy is the game for the NES console that started it all.

The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. "When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come..." And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil Garland, and then the real journey begins...

Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. Which four classes the player chooses for his characters is entirely up to him. He also gives the characters names. 

In the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system; the ATB (active-time battle) system from the later installments is not used. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run.) Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price. 

Spells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up magic points, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.</desc>

The game features the bitter and beautiful tale of four war-orphaned heroes who become embroiled in a conflict between the hostile Empire of Palamecia and the rebel resistance. By eschewing conventional leveling for a proficiency system that allows players to tailor their characters' growth and incorporating a key term memory system that makes dialogue integral to gameplay, this game sparked the spirit of innovation for which the series has become known. This release also contains the bonus dungeons added to later editions of the game--the Soul of Rebirth and the Arcane Labyrinth.</desc>
