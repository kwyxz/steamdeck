		<name>1552 Tenka Tairan</name>
		<desc>1552 Tenka Tairan is a war strategy game set during the Sengoku period of the Japanese history (1552-1600) when ambitious daimyo (feudal lords) began to overthrow their superiors, resulting in a global war for dominance in Japan. The player controls a warlord, choosing one of the available historical figures or creating their own character. Character creation is Ultima-style where are a series of questions generates the player-controlled general with relevant statistics.

The gameplay involves managing the army, advancing the troops, conquering neighboring provinces, defending castles with a wealth of tactical possibilities. Though the game pauses when the player makes a decision, the time advances regardless of the player's actions, effectively making Tenka Tairan a real-time strategy game.</desc>

		<path>./Addams Family, The (USA).chd</path>
		<name>The Addams Family</name>
		<desc>Based on the Addams Family movie, this game is quite different from the other Addams Family variants. The player is cast in the role of Tully Alford, the crooked lawyer of the Addams family. He finds out that somewhere in the family mansion, a great treasure is stored in a vault. He decides to venture into the mansion and retrieve the treasure. Naturally, this is going to be anything but easy, as the insane Addams family members and a legion of ghosts and monsters are there to make sure the lawyer fails...

Like most other Addams Family incarnations, this is a side-scrolling action game. Tully Alford's only weapon is an umbrella that fires energy shots at enemies. Tully can also jump and duck to avoid enemy blows. The game world consists of a "hub" area, the hall of Addams Family mansion, and many rooms, most of which are locked in the beginning of the game. The gameplay consists mainly of exploring the accessible rooms and collecting keys that are needed to open other doors in the process. Some of the rooms contain treasure and power-ups, while others are infested by monsters or require the player to defeat a boss enemy in order to advance.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to the first Cho Aniki (Super Big Brother) game, this is very Japanese in its bizarreness. It's a shoot ?em up, with the player taking the role of an almost nude muscle-man (Adon) or his brother (Samson) in a 2 player game. Their main weapon is a ball of energy that grows over a hole in their heads and shoots out towards any advancing enemies. Other, more powerful shots are achieved by a combination of back-forward-fire, down-up-fire etc on the pad. Through the levels you will encounter all manner of nasties out to get you, but you are aided by a woman in blue that flies around and drops power-ups conveniently for you. Also, levels vary from the standard left-to-right to vertically scrolling.</desc>

		<name>Alnam no Kiba: Juuzoku Juuni Shinto Densetsu</name>
		<desc>Kenbu is a young warrior who trains in the art of shape-shifting - his people possess the ability to turn into beasts. One day, his home village is attacked by a hideous spider-like monster. Kenbu's best friend and mentor dies protecting him. The young hero kills the monster, but soon thereafter has to leave the village and find out who or what was behind that attack. Kenbu encounters other heroes, and together they must stop the evil that is threatening the entire world.

Alnam no Kiba ("Fang of Alnam") is a traditional Japanese RPG. Kenbu and his party roam the top-down world, walking on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. The battles are viewed from the same top-down perspective as the navigation (like in Alshark). Every action in battle depletes a certain amount of spirit points. The heroes can use regular attacks, magic, and unite attacks, that do high damage to all enemies, but consume a lot of spirit points.</desc>

		<name>Avenger</name>
		<desc>A devastating atomic war wiped out the biggest cities on the Earth and most of its population. Anarchy reigned, different military organizations fighting each other in a new war for dominance. One of such organizations eventually seized control of the planet, establishing itself as a tyrannic government and using advanced technology for military purposes. Only a lone pilot can save humanity from their clutches...

Avenger is a vertically-scrolling shooter, in which the player navigates a plane through levels populated by hostile planes, tanks, cannons, ships, stationary devices, and massive boss enemies. Before each mission, the player can choose among different weapons in three categories: main, sub, and special. Main and sub weapons are fired simultaneously and have unlimited ammunition, while the powerful special attacks are accessed by pressing a different button and are limited. The player can try any combination of the three categories, for example enhancing the main rocket launcher with a pod that fires laser to the sides as a sub weapon, and a protective shield as a special one. Power-ups change properties rapidly, so the player has to catch them at a specific time to enhance either main, sub, or special weapon. Those power-ups do not change the properties of a weapon, but rather give it additional fire power.</desc>

Apart from watching out for the baby's dropping health (represented as an increasingly tearful face), the baby's diaper gets wetter over time and the thirst increases, too. If the diaper becomes too wet or the baby becomes too thirsty, the player immediately loses a life, so collecting fresh bottles and diapers is important.</desc>

The show consists of short episodes which are depictions of comical situations, and are not related to each other story-wise. Same can be applied to the game: there is no real story, just a stretch of hilarious and intentionally impossible situations the protagonists find themselves in.</desc>

		<name>Basted</name>
		<desc>Two young and lovely bounty huntresses, Ryeza and Anita, live in a village that is continuously attacked by monsters. One day, solving a little monster problem in the nearby forest, they encounter a mysterious masked man, who tells Ryeza she wields the power of the sacred jewel Basted. Soon the two girls join forces with a princess in exile, and work together to restore the throne to its rightful owners, persecuted by the ruthless Empire and its allies.

Though Basted may look like an RPG at first sight (medieval setting, top-down world, game progression that alternates between towns and dungeons, etc.), it is in fact primarily an action game. Controlling Ryeza and Anita, the player explores the surroundings, talks to people and participates in battles to advance the story. There are no levels, items, equipment, money system, or other required RPG elements.

Most battles occur as dictated by the plot, though some are optional. The battles take place on a separate screen. For most battles, the player is able to choose either Ryeza or Anita. Ryeza can jump, and Anita has a long-ranged fire attack. Regular attacks can be powered-up if executed when the attack power meter is at maximum. Both girls can also charge power to execute devastating special attacks (two unique attacks per girl). They are also able to dash and attack while dashing, inflicting more damage.

The game features a large amount of fully voiced anime-style cutscenes to advance the story.</desc>

		<name>Bazaru Degozaru No Game Degozaru</name>
		<desc>Bazaru de Gozaru no Game de Gozaru is a puzzle game starring a monkey protagonist named Bazaru. The concept of the game is remotely similar to that of Lemmings: the player's task is to "program" the actions of the hero in order to safely traverse a stage full of traps and hazards. Unlike Lemmings, there is only one primate to control in this game; also, the player's "programming" must be performed before letting the monkey loose, unlike the real-time player input in Lemmings.

The player basically orders the monkey what to do at specific spots (which are highlighted by exclamation marks on the level map). In the beginning the levels are short and simple, and the monkey can perform only one action. As the game advances, the puzzles become more and more complex, and so is the amount of actions the monkey must perform to reach safety.</desc>

Blood Gear is a role-playing game with action-based combat. The general gameplay system is somewhat similar to that of the Exile series: town exploration is performed from the standard "RPG-like" top-down view, while all hostile areas are presented as side-scrolling levels, sometimes with elaborate platform structures. Both melee and ranged weapons (pistols, assault rifles, laser guns, etc.) can be purchased in stores and/or found while exploring hostile areas. Health is restored with repair kits of various efficiency, which can also be purchased, found, or randomly dropped by enemies.</desc>

		<desc>Another western game converted to the PC Engine by Micro World, Builderland has a concept similar to the infamous Lemmings, and requires equally sharp forethought and reactions. The aim is to escort your little buddy across the vast playing area without him getting stuck, burned up, eaten by sheep etc. To do this, you can pick up and move various items that are scattered around the landscape, such as blocks to fill in gaps or create handy slopes, bombs to destroy areas of the map and so on. All this time your red headed friend is moving forward with alarming rapidity towards his doom. Thankfully, you can freeze the action to give yourself some breathing space to juggle things around, but this is limited to a timer which counts down slowly at the top of the screen.</desc>

There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump.</desc>

		<name>Cal 3 - Kanketsu-hen</name>
		<desc>Two years have passed since Wataru Ishibashi, an ordinary high-school student in modern-day Japan, visited the magic world of beautiful goddesses and rescued his girlfriend Mika. It seems he can now finally enjoy a peaceful time with his beloved girl. But one day, his old friend Ches, a cute cat-like fairy girl, appears in his room and summons him to the world of gods. It appears that Venus, the goddess of love, is in trouble due to the unforeseen events that have led to the outbreak of the Trojan war. Wataru is about to begin another adventure in the world of gods and ancient cultures.

Cal III is a Japanese-style adventure with visual novel characteristics. The player interacts with characters and is given several dialogue options or actions to choose from. There is no other interaction with the environment, and the progress is strictly linear. Most choices are optional, and only a few lead to Game Over. The computer versions of the game contain a few scenes with nudity, but overall the sexual content is by far milder than in the predecessors.</desc>

		<path>./Camp California (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Camp California</name>
		<desc>Camp California is the second and last game based on the short-lived multimedia property of the same name, featuring a group of anthropomorphic animals who are the official mascots of surf rock group The Beach Boys.

In the game, the gnarly surfer dudes of the Camp California crew find that their favorite beach has been sold to a villain called the Big Cheese who plans to build a nuclear power plant in the area. The gang's plan: hold a benefit concert to raise enough money to buy back the beach. Unfortunately, the Big Cheese gets wind of the plan and sends his henchmen, the Ratz, to kidnap the crew, steal their instruments and take the tires off Woody, the gang's trusty vehicle. Luckily, Byron the bear was out surfing while this happened, and it now falls to him to rescue his friends and get back the tires and the instruments.

The game is a side-scrolling platformer consisting of nine levels, with such areas as a beach, a junkyard, an amusement park, an army base and a mall. The levels are reached via an overview map of California that players drive along in Woody. To start the car, the tires must be found in the first level. All other levels then contain instruments or members of the crew to rescue. At the start, players can only control Byron, but once a new friend has been rescued, they can be selected to be played at the beginning of a level. All characters differ in abilities. Byron punches and kicks to defeat enemies while Lil' Bro (the star of the previous game) uses his skateboard to skid or jump on top of the bad guys. Shred can turn into a tornado, Pouch headbutts and is also the only one who can swim underwater, and Scream'r uses a boomerang and is the only one who can fly.

Besides many enemies (mostly the Ratz gang, but also robotic dogs and other critters) the levels include recyclables to pick up, like soda cans and banana peels. When a level is completed, the trash is converted into fuel for Woody. If the fuel runs out on the overview map, the car can only be restarted at the loss of a life.

The game features voiced cutscenes and CD-quality background music, including three Beach Boys tracks: Fun, Fun, Fun, I Get Around and Good Vibrations.</desc>

The idyllic life of the Alurean people was shattered when the King is killed by a dragon, and a range of nasties inhabit the lands. Fortunately his twin sons have come to the rescue, and you must take control of one or the other to put the world right.

The boys have differing skills - one is more skilled in sword-fighting (which you are always armed with), the other in magic (available in limited amounts on each level). You collect coins as the game goes on, and spend these in the shop on extra magic, extra lives and enhanced swords.

There are 3 levels on offer - Earth, The Heavens and The Sea, and these can be tackled in any order. The first is straight platform action, the second involves jumping across clouds, and the third sees your characters swim. After those are completed, you must venture into the Monster Castle and finally slay the dragon.</desc>

Van soon discovers that Laura possesses mysterious powers that may grant immortality to the one who marries her. That is exactly what the evil wizard Galam has in mind. Van sets off to rescue Laura, on a quest that involves intergalactic journeys and travel through time.

Cosmic Fantasy 2 is a sequel to Cosmic Fantasy: B?ken Sh?nen Yuu, and the only installment in the series to have been released in the West. Though initially not directly related to its predecessor story-wise, the game features several common characters and themes. 

Like the previous game, it is a Japanese-style RPG set in a mixed sci-fi and medieval world. The game has random enemy encounters and simple turn-based combat mechanics. Player-controlled characters can learn and use various offensive and healing spells; however, enemies are restricted to physical attacks. Characters join and leave the party frequently, as dictated by the plot; the party may contain up to four active combatants. Story progression and overworld exploration is linear; dungeons are usually fairly complex and maze-like. Full-screen anime-style cutscenes with voice-overs advance the story of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Twin Hawk is a typical vertical scrolling shooter with a top-down view. Your goal is easy, shoot all the enemies along the way. You only get a standard gun on your plane, and no bombs. Instead of bombs you can call helper planes. These planes make a formation around you and help to shoot all enemies.

Along the way you get the chance to collect power-ups by shooting transport trucks. When these are destroyed they release a power-up. There are three types. First is the weapon upgrade, with this you get a wider and more powerful shot. Second, you get more calls for helper planes. And third are extra lives.

		<desc>Based on the popular Doraemon franchise, Nobita no Dorabian Night follows the adventures of the titular robotic cat, as he tries to rescue his friends from different time periods. How did this happen? Naturally, because of Nobita, Doraemon's best friend and geek extraordinaire. Something went wrong when Nobita was showing his friends a time machine, so they ended up stranded in hostile worlds, and now it's Doraemon's job to save them!

The game is a traditional platformer; Doraemon's main activities are jumping his way through the levels and eliminating enemies who try to stop him. Doraemon starts with an ordinary gun, but later is able to find other weapons, including a homing bowling ball launcher and a stun gun. He can also collect various power-ups, such as limited invincibility, high speed, an item that freezes all the enemies on the level for a short time, etc. It is possible to switch weapons and power-ups at any time.</desc>

Once again, the players assume the role of brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee, who are now tasked with the duty of avenging Marian's death. The arcade version of the game is essentially an improved version of the original title. The biggest change in the game's controls are in the replacement of the original's punch and kick buttons with two directional-based attack buttons (Left Attack and Right Attack) similar to Renegade. Pressing the attack button of the player's current direction will do a standard series of punches, while pressing the opposite attack button will perform a back kick. A few new moves are added as well, including a Hurricane Kick.</desc>

Nec Avenue certainly acknowledged that the game's best asset was the unique and innovative ability to jack-in and dive into computerized cyber-space worlds. This sequel follows the same formula but also features probably one of most electrifying storyline ever written for a video game. The brain of Adolf Hitler has been digitized inside a computer mainframe by terrorists and Syd, an elite cyber-diver and protagonist of the game, embarks on a perilous journey to stop and destroy the incoming threat. On board his ship and helped by the cute Deva, Syd flies through nine enemy infested areas and dives into abstract and challenging cyber worlds. Four different weapons are available to him at the press of a button - multiway Vulcan-gun, wide laser-beams, spread homing-lasers and a short-range lightning gun. Each weapon can be powered-up a grand total of three times by collecting "P" pods that appear on the screen whereas "S" pods increase the overall speed of the ship. Other special items are available throughout the game such as smart-bombs and protective shields.</desc>

A wealthy school principal has placed a challenge for all the school gangs to compete in a special obstacle course composed of 4 different challenges that you and your team must overcome. First in line is a race across the city streets (and rooftops), next is an obstacle course filled with dangerous hazards, then a jumping challenge in which you have to break a series of metal balls, and finally an all-out fighting tournament.

The game uses the same engine and basic gameplay mechanics featured in other Nekketsu High games, with the only change being the goals you must complete to clear each stage. Seeing as how the characters are gang members, fighting and beating your opponents can be a viable way of winning the challenges, so several weapons and power-ups can also be found in the courses </desc>

The game does not let the player completely control Goku, instead choosing whether he is on the offense, defense, powering up, or running. There are also cutscenes that may happen in the middle of battle, triggered by certain actions from the series, such as Goku breaking Tao's sword with the Power Pole.</desc>

The only way to do that is use the sacred Gourd, which, in its turn, can be made only after having acquired three sacred artifacts. Together with her friends Lufa, Pia, and Princess Vina, Mink embarks on a quest for the artifacts, hoping to defeat Azetodeth once and for all!

This interpretation of Ryuusuke Mita's manga Dragon Half is entirely different from the  computer version. It is a combination of a board game and an RPG. Up to 4 players can compete, each controlling a party of characters from the manga. The navigation takes place on a large board, and is controlled by dice rolls. The player can advance only as many steps as the number on the dice; however, most of the board has many different paths and crossroads, which allows certain freedom of movement and planning. 

Different spots on the board have a variety of effects on the party. Red-colored spots lead to turn-based enemy encounters. The player must press a button in time to choose an attack by a specific party member, and also to determine its strength. Experience points are rewarded after battles, and the characters level up in a fashion similar to other Japanese RPGs.

Other places on the board include damage traps, shops, trigger meetings with other characters, lead to healing spots such as pools and hotels.</desc>

		<desc>Strawberry Fields - a magic country populated almost exclusively by beautiful young girls (that is, if we don't count the Wise Old Man and a couple of other male exceptions). All went well in this peaceful place, until the evil witch Mesaana abducted some of the country's lovely inhabitants and placed a curse upon them, turning them into hideous monsters. Enter Takeru Yamato (whom you might know as Desmond, the hero of Knights of Xentar), a young adventurer who happens to be in Strawberry Fields at that time. Takeru is told that in order to remove the curse one has to find three sacred writings, buried deep within three dangerous dungeons. Looks like a job for our adventurer - especially because the rescued girls will probably be very grateful!

Dragon Knight II is the predecessor to Knights of Xentar, the only Dragon Knight game that was ever translated into English. This is a first-person game that is mainly dedicated to dungeon exploring. Takeru has to explore the three dungeons, fighting enemies and sometimes talking to dungeon inhabitants. The enemies are the girls who were turned into monsters by Mesaana. In town, Takeru can also buy weapons, armor, and items, and talk to various people.</desc>

Unlike in the computer version, the battles are not real-time, but turn-based, and utilize a different perspective; randomly encountered enemies are fought in a first-person, Dragon Quest-like traditional Japanese RPG style. Enemy design is also quite different; many of the monsters from the original version have been replaced with female characters. The graphics in the top-down areas have been slightly enhanced.

This version also censors the adult content. The scenes are still suggestive, but there is no explicit nudity in them any more. Some of the cutscenes have been completely re-drawn, eliminating even implicit sexual activity.</desc>

After having escaped from a slave ship, through a series of events they come into possession of a powerful crest. This crest was taken away from the benevolent prince and princess, who were abducted by an evil cults that worships an ancient powerful deity. The two young women must find a way to save the royal offsprings, and defeat the evil worshippers.

The game is an RPG with action-based combat. The player can choose to play as either Efera or Jiliora; there is also a two-player mode in which it is possible to control both. Efera is the weaker fighter, but she can use healing and offensive magic spells, which she learns as she levels up. Jiliora is stronger, but unable to cast magic; as she advances in levels, she obtains rings that can enhance her sword power, heal an amount of her HP, and even make her invincible for a while.

As in most RPGs, player-controlled characters traverse hostile areas and fight enemies for experience and money, which can later be spent in towns to acquire better equipment and items.

		<path>./Far East of Eden - Tengai Makyou - Ziria (Japan) (Rev 7).chd</path>
		<name>Tengai Makyou - Ziria</name>
		<desc>Long time ago, humans lived in a paradise, the Garden of Eden. But the brave and audacious members of the Fire Clan were banned from Eden, and had to seek shelter on the Earth. They built their own paradise - the land they later called Jipang. However, the evil demon lord Masakado wanted to destroy Jipang, and the Fire Clan fought and defeated him. Now, many years later, a young thief named Ziria learns that he is a descendant of the Fire Clan. He must now find the other members, and prevent the resurrection of Masakado by his followers.

Loosely based on the Japanese folk tale of the ninja Jiraiya, Tengai Maky?: Ziria was the first role-playing game released on a CD ROM; thanks to the medium's greater storage capacity, the game was able to include full-screen anime-style cutscenes with voice-overs. It is the first entry in the Tengai Maky? series, and is generally considered the first RPG with significant humorous content. The game's setting parodies many aspects of feudal Japan, containing comical and sometimes deliberately stereotypical portrayals of characters and plenty of supernatural elements.

Basic gameplay mechanics follow a template introduced in early Dragon Quest and Phantasy Star games. The player navigates Ziria and other characters who eventually join him on a top-down overworld, visiting towns to rest and buy supplies, and facing randomly appearing enemies in round-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Each character uses his or her own unique weapon and equipment types. Magic spells cannot be bought or learned automatically when leveling up; they must be sought out in specific locations, often those not required to visit in order to advance the story. 

The game's overworld is fairly vast, divided into provinces, each containing several towns and other locations. It is possible to teleport instantly from the world map to any previously visited province.The game emphasizes overworld exploration; dungeons tend to be smaller and less maze-like than in many other contemporary role-playing games. In towns, the player can gamble and deposit money in banks; this money is preserved if the party is annihilated in combat and transported back to the town, with the money it was carrying cut in half. When a character levels up, his or her hit points (HP) and magic points (MP) are fully restored.</desc>

		<name>Tengai Makyo II: Manji Maru</name>
		<desc>Many years ago, the legendary warriors of the Fire Clan were expelled from the Garden of Eden, and built the wonderful land Jipang. Thousand years later, Jipang is entering its medieval era. It seems that the province Hida is suffering from a curse placed upon it by the evil clan of the Dark Orchids. To destroy the Orchids, a young boy named Manjimaru has to fight the demons who protect them, find companions who would help him on the quest, and prove he is worthy of his great legacy as the descendant of the Fire Clan.

Tengai Maky? II: Manjimaru is a sequel to Tengai Maky?: Ziria. Though not connected to its predecessor directly story-wise, the game is set in the same semi-humorous rendition of feudal Japan, and shares many recurrent gameplay-related and stylistic elements. The player navigates a party of up to four characters on a vast overworld divided into provinces, each with its own capital city and several smaller towns. Randomly encountered enemies are fought in turn-based, first-person view combat. Like in the previous game, magic spells must be obtained by locating Tengu Retreats; they can be then equipped on any character and swapped between them.

Enemy hit points are displayed during battles, and characters are restored to full health when leveling up. Full-screen anime-style cutscenes with voiceovers advance the story. As opposed to the previous game, Manjimaru has several audio music tracks in addition to synthesized ones. </desc>

One day he is contacted by a woman named Beth, who offers him a more demanding job, which involves investigating shady activities between humans and fiends, and getting to the bottom of the entire mystery, discovering the origin of the fiends and determine their ultimate fate.

Fiend Hunter is a cinematic platformer set in an Old West-like environment with supernatural elements. With the exception of the initial town and a few other locations, the game is spent in areas that require carefully navigating Feed through a series of platform-like structures. Controls and animation resemble those of Prince of Persia. Feed can jump, run, perform a running jump, hang on ledges, pull up or drop down, kneel and crawl. He also takes falling damage; the primary challenge during platforming sequences consists of preventing him from falling down.

Enemies only appear at pre-set points; each battle is one-on-one, and it is impossible to escape from a fight. Coupled with the enemies' high HP count and varied attack patterns, this essentially turns each encounter into a boss battle. Feed fights with a sword and can perform various moves, combining attacks with jumping and ducking. He can also gain access to a few magic spells.

A little fire fiend named Exy accompanies Feed on his journey. Exy can be used as offensive and defensive enhancement in combat, and can also be set to light dark areas. Each enemy drops a special orb that can be used to increase Feed's vitality, attack power, or magic, as well as teach Exy more powerful attacks, which gives the game a light RPG flavor. Feed can also equip rings and buy or find health-restoring and protective potions.</desc>

The galaxy police sends two agents to deal with the threat: Hiro Aoyama and Michiko Akasaka, who can transform into the powerful super-fighters Gayvan and Mittchi, respectively, and are alone able to stop Ballas.

Galaxy Deka Gayvan is a brawler. Players can choose to control either of the two heroes, or both of them in a co-op mode. Like in other beat-em-up games, the player must defeat all the enemies on screen in hand-to-hand combat before being able to proceed. Both Hiro and Michiko can accumulate special energy (dropped by the enemies along with health power-ups and money) that allows them to transfer into the superheroes Gayvan and Mittchi and stay in that form until they run out of energy. The superhero forms are stronger and are able to execute special attacks.

In addition, a two-player versus fighting mode is included. Players can choose either the protagonists or three enemy characters to compete against each other in one-on-one fighting.</desc>

Humans have constructed a super-computer known as MESIA, entrusting it with the task of monitoring everything that happens on the planet. However, the computer grew increasingly megalomaniac, and eventually decided to conquer the Earth with deadly machines of its own production. In the middle of the 23rd century, humanity engages in a decisive battle against MESIA. Their hopes lie with Ken Ryugasaki, who pilots the powerful mecha Tracer on his journey to the super-computer's lair.

Genocide is a side-scrolling action game. The player controls Tracer, who can fight with a sword-like melee weapon and jump. Later in the game Tracer acquires "Betty", a powerful weapon that can shoot in eight directions. The gameplay is fairly straightforward; there are no power-ups, and the bulk of the game consists of surviving continuous onslaughts of enemies.</desc>

		<desc>In the future, time travel became a regular commodity. Criminal organizations began using advanced science in order to escape into different time periods to avoid capture. To counter that, a special police unit called "Burning Rabbits" was formed, consisting of four young ladies who bravely pilot their fighter craft through time and space.

Ginga Fukei Densetsu: Sapphire is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up. The player can choose between four different female characters, each piloting a different ship: Sapphire has balanced strength is speed; Charlotte is the fastest, but also the weakest; Helen is the slowest and the strongest; Jasmine is the second-strongest and the second-slowest. The ships are also distinguished by their weapon properties. Each ship can collect red, green, or blue power-ups; collecting a power-up of the same color enhances the currently equipped weapon, while a differently-colored power-up changes weapon properties while retaining whatever enhancements the ship might have had with the previous weapon. The actual properties of each weapon is different for each ship, and include various combinations of lasers, beams, missiles, piercing and homing weapons.

Each ship also has two pods on the sides that fire simultaneously. If the player releases the fire button for five seconds, the pods will charge up and damage enemies with electricity during the next shot. In additions, the ships can also drop bombs that heavily damage all the enemies on the screen; up to two bombs can be carried at the same time. The stages include various themes such as medieval, feudal China, ancient Egypt, etc., all with a strong sci-fi angle. The player can continue up to nine times from the same spot if the protagonist runs out of lives, and additional continues are granted when the player gathers a sufficient amount of points.</desc>

This is a horizontal fighting game, where you basically take one of the three characters (the barbarian Ax Battler, a dwarf named Gilius Thunderhead or the amazon Tyris Flare) and bash everything which stands between you and Death Adder himself. Each character has a special magical ability that can be charged by kicking small blue creatures that drop a potion. There is also a green variety off this creature that drops food that replenishes your health. Some enemies ride dragons and a scorpion like creature. The enemies can be knocked off and you can mount the creature yourself and attack the enemies with it.

The game allows to play up to two players on a same screen, however in the C64 version this option has not been implemented. C64 version was also stripped off in the other areas, such as: only one enemy can engage the player at a time or there are only two types of dragons instead of three.</desc>

Player-controlled mechas and vehicles come in different types: some are strong but have limited manoeuvrability, others have a wide movement range but weak armor, etc. Battles are shown on a separate screen and proceed automatically, both sides exchanging an attack.</desc>

The player manages the hero's daily schedule, divided into two segments: school and home. Activities include studying, having conversations with students or teachers, taking part-time jobs, resting, talking on the phone, shopping, buying presents, etc. Each activity increases or decreases some of the hero's parameters. The overall level can be evaluated on a special screen, and the goal is to raise it by balancing the stats with various activities.</desc>

The player-controlled fighter can pick up power-ups that change his primary weapon: red for a vulcan gun, yellow for energy bolts, and blue for laser. Each of these will increase in power (e.g. three lasers instead of one for the blue weapon) when the player repeatedly collects power-ups of the same color. Other power-ups add a secondary weapon or enhancement to any of the described above, such as homing missiles, fireballs, a wingman, etc. Secondary weapons are fired simultaneously with the main ones. In addition, special weapons can be collected and accumulated. These weapons are triggered by pressing a separate button, and include delayed bombs, exploding bullets, protective shields, and others.</desc>

		<desc>A scientist named Arnold Steiner researches the ancient civilization of Indios in Central America. However, following a breakthrough discovery, Steiner mysteriously disappears. His daughter Chris travels to Central America in search of her father, and steps into an intimidating world of monsters and conspiracies.

Hih? Densetsu: Chris no B?ken is a platformer. Chris is armed with a dagger and cannot use any other weapons or gadgets to protect herself. However, the dagger can be upgraded by collecting colored orbs dropped by enemies. Depending on their combination, the dagger can be used as a long-ranged weapon, firing projectiles or acting as a boomerang. The protagonist's health is measured with hearts; a stage must be restarted if Chris runs out of all five of them. Enemies would sometimes leave hearts and coins behind; the latter add an extra life to Chris if she collects a sufficient amount. 

A boss enemy awaits at the end of every second stage. Other features include moving and disappearing platforms, deadly traps such as spikes, mine cart-riding, and a strict time limit for each stage. The story is advanced through anime-style cutscenes between stages.</desc>

		<name>Horror Story</name>
		<desc>Originating on the arcades (where it was known as Demon's World to the Western audience), Horror Story is an "old-style" side-scrolling platformer/shooter. The basic gameplay premise is very simple: shoot and jump your way through large amounts of monsters, defeat the boss, proceed to the next level. There is no narrative of any kind in the game, and no cut scenes; the hero is a tough-looking  Duke Nukem-look-alike equipped with guns. 

The screen is scrolling at all times, even if the player character doesn't move. The levels are almost entirely linear, the only choice sometimes being to stay on the ground or jump to the higher platforms. Cooperative two-player mode is available.

Though shooting is decidedly the main gameplay element here, jumping (particularly double-jumping) must be used liberally to navigate the hero through platform-based stages, and avoid and kill enemies (since jumping on their heads eliminates them as well). Weapons can be switched by catching power-ups, which appear as floating, constantly changing letters. Depending on the letter the player decides to take, the hero will get different weapons. These weapons include: a steady energy beam of moderate power; flamethrower; bombs; a short-distance grenade launcher of sorts; and a gun that spits fireballs in three different directions.

As the name implies, the game has a horror theme. The game begins in what looks like old Japan, complete with traditional Japanese demons, but later switches to more "mainstream" horror, complete with haunted towns, ghosts, zombies, skeletons, etc.</desc>

There are two modes in the game: Normal and Tournament. In the normal mode up to four players can compete against each other or computer opponent in stroke play, match play, driving range, and putting green. Real Japanese golf courses are available for selection, complete with digitized photos and introductions. The player can select to control Japanese golfers and choose between a variety of clubs, as well as manually influence the shot, controlling force, angle, and the exact part of the ball the player wishes to strike.

The Tournament mode is essentially a managerial simulation game. The player takes control of a golfer in an unnamed city. The goal is to accumulate enough currency and fame, as well as increase personal attributes of the golfer in order to participate in tournaments. Currency is obtained by doing part-time jobs, e.g. as a caddie in golf matches, or by gambling at slot machines. The player can also visits shops to purchase clubs and other golfing equipment. There is an in-game schedule that keeps track of tournaments and also incorporates random events (such as accidents). It is also possible to send the golfer on a vacation when he is too tired from working or practicing golf.</desc>

The game involved gathering at night, lighting a hundred candles and telling horror stories, extinguishing the candles one by one until the room became completely dark.

The game contains a hundred horror stories told in a linear fashion through text, digitized photos and sound effects. Most of the stories are very short and non-interactive. The exceptions usually involve visual novel-like choices of locations or responses to situations, which sometimes affect the story's conclusion. A recurrent episode involves visiting various locations in Tokyo area and reviewing criminal cases and ghost stories.

The game takes place in Ancient Japan where sword fights meet mystical magic and demons... but not only as later stages even transport the player to futuristic worlds and cities. The main character uses his sword most of the time to defeat his enemies. But he can also charge up and throw knives. RUN can also launch a mystical attack. But use those wisely as they are only available in a limited quantities. As expected in this sort of game, a boss awaits for you at the end of each stage and unlocks new powers and weapons when defeated.</desc>

		<name>Fray in Magical Adventure CD : Xak Gaiden</name>
		<desc>This version of Fray in Magical Adventure differs from the  original MSX and subsequent computer releases in several ways. It retains the major events of the story and gameplay mechanics; even though it has more detailed graphics, it still looks too similarly to the original release to be qualified as a remake. The major difference is in the layout of locations and enemies. Some levels are entirely different, even when they are composed of the same elements. For example, the introductory level of the original version is skipped; the subsequent level has a different layout and new enemies. There are more treasure chests in this version's levels, more items, and more areas that require jumping. 

This version also has different cut-scenes (for example, the introduction describes some of the events during Fray's study years, which were absent in the original version). The conversations with other characters are longer; certain events are triggered in a different way (such as the necessity to first talk to the guard to trigger the conversation with the mayor in the first town). There is voice acting during important cut-scenes.</desc>

It is a mix of action and adventure elements, largely inspired from cult-horror B-Movies of the 50's and 60's, and the 1954 film Them in particular. The player plays the part of Dr. Greg Bradley, a geologist and the newest resident in town. Eager to satisfy his scientific mind, Bradley sets out to examine the crash-site of a mysterious meteor, but what he finds is not at all what he had been looking for.</desc>

The brave young ninja Kaze is summoned by Lord Yoshikage and sent on a dangerous mission: infiltrate Hiei's castle, defeat his minions, and rescue Shizuhime.

Kaze Kiri is essentially a beat-em-up with a few distinguishing characteristics. The game consists of traversing fully linear side-scrolling areas, defeating regular enemies and bosses on the way. Before being able to fight the stage boss, Kaze has to vanquish a pre-determined number of enemies, which is displayed as a shared enemy HP on top of the screen.

Kaze attacks with his sword when he is near the enemy, or throws shurikens at them from afar. Enemy projectiles can also be blocked by countering them with shurikens. Kaze can also disappear for a moment and re-appear at another location. He can jump, duck, perform somersaults, and grab and throw enemies. Kaze's health regenerates over time if he is not hit repeatedly. Completing the game unlocks another playable character, the female ninja Suzu.</desc>

		<desc>In 21st century, Tokyo was suddenly attacked by combined forces of robotic and organic alien races. A special giant mecha fighter craft was constructed in order to avert the threat. A young pilot is sent on the most dangerous mission of his life.

Kiaidan 00 is a horizontally scrolling sci-fi shoot-em-up. The basic gameplay is similar to other games of this genre; however, the weapon system differs from the traditional power-up and upgrade style. The player character has all the weapons at his disposal from the very beginning. The five weapons include spreading energy blasts, focused multiple shot, laser beams that travel in different directions, an energy ball that protects the ship from frontal assaults, and an extended arm that hits enemies melee-style. The player can cycle through and choose any of these weapons at any time. 

Instead of the traditional secondary weapon system the game offers charged modes for all the weapons. When a weapon is charged it either becomes more powerful or gains new properties (for example, the extended arm becomes longer and is controlled from a distance). The player character's health is represented by shield units, which can also be picked up in the stages. Dialogue and cutscenes advance the story between and within missions.</desc>

The game starts as the two main characters (Buaisu and Gaimu ?) rescue a beautiful girl (Erena) being chased by dark and evil knights. She joins them and tells the story of an evil man and his army of knights. As any traditional strategy game, fights are round based and always start with a scrollable top view of the battle field. During each round, you can either move your characters or engage a close combat if you are close enough to your enemy. The view then zooms in and displays your opponents and yourself, and enclose any characters near to this area. The game is really varied and the Japanese language is only a limitation if you want to know more about the storyline.</desc>

Shortly thereafter he encounters a young woman named Tifire, who describes herself as a fellow Guardian. Vaice and his friends soon draw the ire of a might empire and have to fight for their lives and the destiny of what they hold dear.

The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, consisting of turn-based battles between Vaice's party and various enemy organizations. Role-playing elements have been enhanced, featuring an experience points system that makes character growth available. Like in the first game, contact with an enemy initiates a separate battle. These battles are more tactical in this installment, taking place on an isometric screen and allowing character movement.

		<path>./Kuusou Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy (Japan).chd</path>
		<name>Kuusou Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy</name>
		<desc>The game is based on the anime Gulliver Boy, created by Teruhisa Hiroi. Gulliver is a young boy who studies magic in a school in a small town in Italy, but is bored with the studies and craves adventure. After he gets his magical diploma, he goes to Venice to hook up with his best friends - the girl Misty, who has healing powers, and the genius inventor Edison. Together, they must stop the plot of the Spanish crown to dominate the world.

K?s? Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy differs greatly from the Super Famicom interpretation of the anime. Unlike that action role-playing game, it is a traditional Japanese-style turn-based RPG. It utilizes traditional battle system with a four-heroes party, physical attacks and magic, etc. Stand-out features include a money system that is based on trading rather than obtaining gold from defeated foes, and the fact that the enemies are visible on the field and the combat initiates once Gulliver comes into contact with them, rather than appearing randomly.

Much of the exploration in the game is done by navigating a ship across the Mediterranean sea. Though story progression is linear, several areas of the game's fairly vast world can be explored in a non-linear fashion. The setting is loosely based on real world locations, with deliberately stereotypical, comical and anachronistic elements, involving science fiction and supernatural themes. The game features full-motion anime-style movies (instead of comic-book-like cutscenes typical for PC Engine CD games) and voice acting.</desc>

All the creatures drawn by the children became alive - but so did a little fighter plane, which the boy immediately boards and goes up towards the skies, searching for the girl.

L-DIS is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up with cartoon-like visuals and humorous overtones. The player can choose between three different weapon setups in the beginning. Power-ups are obtained by shooting little winged yellow creatures encountered in the stages. These power-ups rapidly change properties and can either enhance the strength of the main weapon, add a secondary one, or grant the protagonist protective shields or bombs that can eliminate all the enemies on the screen. Bosses and mini-bosses are present in most of the levels.</desc>

		<desc>In a galaxy called Urora, two star systems were engaged in a prolonged war for domination: the federation of Soron and the Vado Empire. A peace treaty was signed between them; but the governments of either side knew that sooner or later there will be war again. The scientists of Soron developed a highly advanced technique, infusing human organism with powers of spirits. Five young ladies, under the command of Jennifer Sylkis, were imbued with this augmentation, which allowed them to pilot giant combat robots. Soon the fight for galactic supremacy will begin...

Lady Phantom is a turn-based strategy game. The game consists of linear missions, which take the player to large strategic battles; the goal is usually to eliminate all enemy units, though mission objectives such as reaching a certain area or preventing a certain key character from getting killed are also present. The player commands the five combatants, choosing their equipment before each battle. The battle screen is composed of hexagons; the characters have turns depending on their agility rating. When player-controlled or enemy character attack each other, an automatic battle sequence ensues.</desc>

It is set in a typical medieval fantasy setting and features traditional turn-based combat. The player controls several generals who can command up to eight different units ranging from ordinary soldiers and archers to more exotic creatures like mermen or lizards.The generals fight alongside their units, however they are much more powerful and are able to use more diverse commands than just moving and attacking, like recovering a small amount of HP or casting spells. Each unit has certain strengths and weaknesses; for example soldiers are good against archers but weak against cavalry etc. Combat is also influenced heavily by terrain types. When two units engage in combat a small animation, similar to those seen in Advance Wars or Fire Emblem, is shown.</desc>

		<name>Laplace No Ma</name>
		<desc>The town Newcam, Massachusetts, 1924. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...

Laplace no Ma (Devil of Laplace) is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements, somewhat similar to Sweet Home for NES. Unlike Sweet Home, this game is more oriented towards RPG gameplay. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</desc>

		<name>Last Armageddon</name>
		<desc>The Earth has changed. We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.

Last Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic  Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.

Dungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective. The player is able to set and use multiple parties of demons, some of which have unique skills. For example, a flying demon can take the party quicker to some locations, avoiding random encounters.</desc>

		<desc>Legend of Xanadu II continues the story of the first game. Once again, the player controls the adventurer Areios, who emerged victorious after the final battle in the end of the first game. Together with his friend Daimos, Areios is looking for their other friend, who has disappeared. On the way, their ship is attacked by the evil Dragon Riders. It seems the search won't be as easy as they have thought, as Areios gets involved in a dangerous adventure again.

The sequel is very similar to the first game gameplay-wise. The player explores towns, vast outdoor areas, and dungeons, engaging enemies in real-time combat. Damage is inflicted upon the enemies simply by running into them, without any special attack button. There are various weapons to equip, and they level up in proficiency the more the player uses them. Areios gains additional hit points depending on the damage he receives. Party members help him in battles, controlled by the AI. The day and night cycle of the previous game has been removed.

Like in the previous game, there are side-scrolling segments which lead to boss battles at the end of each chapter. Compared to the first game, these stages are noticeably shorter, each containing only the boss fight itself, omitting platforming sections with regular enemies. Bosses must be fought using conventional action gameplay, attacking by pressing a button and jumping to avoid their attacks. It is also possible to defend actively and perform attacks in different directions. The player may opt to fight the bosses alone or select one of the available companions, either AI-controlled or in two-player mode.</desc>

The game has a traditional power-up system with a basic weapon power-up that changes its color rapidly when revealed (red for vulcan gun, green for lasers, blue for missiles), as well as assorted collectible letters that either enhance the strength of the gun with additional shots, add a secondary weapon (such as bombs), or provide the ship with a protective shield. In addition, a powerful all-screen attack can be executed by pressing the second action button. At several points during the game the player is able to choose the next stage among two available ones.

Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</desc>

		<name>Linda Cube</name>
		<desc>An asteroid is nearing the planet Neo Kenya. Scientists warn that the planet might be completely annihilated by it. In a most unexpected turn of events, a deity known as Anubis spoke to people and asked them to save the planet's animals before the asteroids hit it. Anubis sent the humans a huge ship - a magnified version of Noah's Ark - and demanded that one man and one woman should dedicate their time to saving the animals. A whole special team has been assigned to the project. Ken is one of the youngest members of the team, and he is sent on the grand mission to save the animals, together with his childhood sweetheart, the lovely Linda. 

This somewhat unusual premise translated itself into the gameplay mechanics. Though  Linda³ is first and foremost a Japanese-style RPG - with top-down "world map", towns, turn-based combat, simple leveling up, focus on narrative and characters, and so on - it also has gameplay features rarely seen among games of its genre.

There are no random enemies in the game; they are visibly walking on the screen, and a contact with them triggers familiar turn-based battles (viewed from first-person perspective). Hostile animals should not be killed, but captured. They can be then used in towns for a variety of purposes, including weapon and armor enhancement, food, etc.  

Animal saving is pivotal to the game's plot progression; in fact, at the very beginning of the game, the game offers three selectable difficulty levels, which are determined by the amount of animals Ken must save in order to complete the mission.

Beside hostile animals, there are also certain types of animals (such as dogs) that will join the party and fight alongside Ken and Linda.</desc>

		<desc>Loom was the fourth game to use the SCUMM scripting language. The game follows Bobbin Threadbare as he learns how to use his magical powers through his distaff and as he eventually saves the world from the Lord of Chaos, who was unraveling the Loom (the source of power for the members of the weaver's guild).

Loom is an adventure game that sets itself apart from other titles in the genre through its unique gameplay system: the player character does not carry items around, but rather manipulates objects through the use of spells (called "drafts" in the game). The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument called "distaff". All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts. 

Although the PC Engine version is CD based, it isn't a port of the PC CD-ROM version. Instead, it features mixed visuals from the 16- and 256-color versions adapted to the PC Engine's color palette and enhanced CD soundtrack with no spoken dialogue.</desc>

		<name>Martial Champion</name>
		<desc>Martial Champion is a versus fighting game similar in concept to Street Fighter II. There are ten characters to choose from, each representing his or her own country. The main protagonist is a Japanese martial artist named Jin; others include his countryman Zen, a kabuki fighter; a Chinese kung-fu expert and a vampire from Hong-Kong; an Egyptian princess; a scimitar fighter from Saudi Arabia; a spear-wielding Kenyan warrior; a French weapons specialist; and two North Americans - an eyepatched soldier and a blonde female ninja-like fighter. 

There are three modes in the game: a tournament mode, in which these characters compete against each other before facing the final boss; a versus mode; and a group fighting mode, in which each player selects several fighters to represent in a series of one-on-one battles. The fighting scheme resembles that of Yie Ar Kung Fu, though with a simplified handling of high, medium, and low attacks. Some of the characters use weapons in battles; it is possible to knock these weapons out of their hands and use them against their owners.</desc>

One day, four magical orbs fell into the hands of a student named Rin-Rin. The clumsy girl managed to lose all of them, without understanding what this could lead to:  nobody knows what will happen if the orbs fall into wrong hands - those of the dark goddesses! Aided by a little fairy named Pop, Rin-Rin has to gather the legendary goddesses and to find a way to retrieve the orbs.

Megami Tengoku is based on an anime of the same name (translated as Megami Paradise). It plays like a traditional top-down Japanese RPG with turn-based combat. Rin-Rin uses magical spells to fight enemies. An unusual feature of the game is the ability to change clothes, and the fact that every dress changes the graphical appearance of the character.</desc>

		<desc>Yuko Ahso is an ordinary Japanese teenager with an ordinary life - until one day she is attacked by a monster on the street. Out of nowhere, a sword appears in her hands. She fights the monsters who have suddenly invaded the city, and is summoned to the parallel world known as Vecanti, which is ruled by a cruel tyrant named Rogles, whose actions disrupt the balance of the the worlds. Wielding the legendary Valis sword, Yuko must defeat Rogles and restore the balance.

Valis has the same story and basic genre (platform action) as the  original first game in the  series; however, it is a different game with different locations, regular enemies and bosses, new cutscenes, etc.  Defeating the numerous enemies populating the game world requires precise usage of jumping and ducking abilities, and attack timing. Yuko can jump very high and attack while jumping. Various power-ups are scattered through the game, many of which enhance the performance of Yuko's sword. Acting as a melee weapon in the beginning, it can be customized with power-ups and turn into a medium-range weapon, firing shots at the enemies - with proper power-ups, also in different directions. Boss enemies typically have different attack patterns and require different strategies to defeat them.</desc>

A group of four treasure hunters come across an announcement promising a reward of one million credits to whoever would recover a mysterious purple stone with the engraving of the Empire's crest on it. The four find the artifact relatively quickly, but it is stolen from them by another group with an agenda of their own. Now the heroes must bring the stone back while dealing with the dangerous foes on their way.

Mystic Formula is a top-down shooter. The player navigates the protagonist through hostile environments, shooting at regular enemies and bosses, and avoiding their attacks. The player can choose to control any of the four treasure hunters: a balanced lead character armed with a laser pistol; an elf who shoots fireballs from her staff; an agile female thief; and a sturdy, slow, yet powerful robot. All the characters use ranged attacks that can be upgraded with power-ups. In addition, another type of a power-up brings forth one of the characters from the group to aid the player in combat, controlled by the AI. Two-player mode is available as well.</desc>

One day, however, she learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. Her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.

Popful Mail is a platform action game with very light RPG elements. As the heroine makes her way through the stages she collects money from slain foes. This money can be used in shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. The game features interaction with many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as the player progresses through the game.

This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the  earlier version, but otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely different graphics, locations, enemies, challenges, etc.</desc>

		<name>Prince Of Persia</name>
		<desc>While the Sultan of Persia is fighting a war in a foreign country, his Grand Vizier Jaffar orchestrates a coup d'état. His way to the throne lies through the Sultan's lovely daughter. Jaffar kidnaps her and threatens to kill her if she refuses to marry him. Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place.

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platform genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.

The protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro, an altered set of graphics and four new levels.</desc>

In Princess Maker 2 the player assumes the role of a father to the blessed daughter of the heavens. For the next eight years, the hero will nurture and guide her in the path of the player's own choosing.

It is possible to choose the path of the zodiac-influenced daughter by scheduling her to jobs and schools, which will raise her statistics (strength, combat skills, cooking, faith, etc.) Each month allows the player to designate three different tasks for her to follow. Balancing between character development, stress level, health and financial income is the focus of this game.

Mini sub-quests and various plot options revolve around  the young lady adventuring in the wilderness, provided that she's strong enough to tame the wilds. The player can equip her with armor and weapons to fight off wandering random monsters in turn-based combat.

The game starts with the daughter at age ten, from which point the player guides her until her adult years. Choices made during the course of the game will determine her eventual marital status, accomplishments and her relationships with other people. There are 74 unique endings in the game.</desc>

Princess Minerva is one of them. She participates in a tournament, battles against the best female fighters of the country, and ultimately joins forces with them, building a super-powerful party that is bound to defeat the archenemy of the Queen of Whistler, the evil sorceress Dynastar.

The game begins where the girls are already united and are getting ready for the grand quest. Your party contains nine girls, each one with various statistics and magic spells. The large party is divided into three smaller ones, and you switch between them while participating in random battles and fighting bosses. The combat is turn-based, and is viewed from a top-down perspective, like the locations you visit. You travel on the overworld map, visit towns, and descend into dungeons. The three active girls in your party can also unite to perform combo attacks. </desc>

		<desc>Like most games based on the  Ranma 1/2 manga and anime series, Dat?, Ganso Musabetsu Kakut?-Ry?! is a fighting game. Unlike the  earlier Ranma 1/2 iteration by the  same company, this game does not follow the main manga/anime story, and does not include any other gameplay elements beside one-on-one fighting. However, the game is still rich on story-telling; fully voiced anime-style cut scenes appear after each battle and serve to put Ranma in various situations and set the stage for battles against familiar character from the manga and anime, such the old pervert Happousai, Mousse, Ryuga, etc.  

The Vs. mode allows two-player gameplay; the players can choose any combinations of the characters who appear in the game to test their skills. As Ranma, the player can revert to his female form (this time at will, simply by pressing a button); the female Ranma is more agile but less powerful. The combat system includes characteristic fighting game mechanics, with punches, kicks, jumps, combinations of buttons to execute specific moves, and powerful special attacks, which can be executed after charging the power.</desc>

As before, there is a temperature bar, so if it turns red it must cool down before running again, but now it is much easier to regulate the duration of your run without resorting to a turbo button. The level structure and the attack patterns of the enemy are also much more balanced to take into account the use of the board: you are no longer forced to throw yourself headlong into a phalanx of enemies because something is chasing your tail. It has legitimately become a useful tool in your arsenal.</desc>

		<name>Lodoss Tou Senki - Record Of Lodoss War</name>
		<desc>The game is based on the novel cycle Record of Lodoss War by Ryo Mizuno, and more closely on subsequent manga volumes and OVA series. Its story generally follows the one of the OVA, the main hero being Parn, a young man who grows up in a small village and later becomes one of the strongest warriors in the world, thanks to his father's mysterious heritage and his own courage. Like in the anime series, the game begins with a goblin attack and with Parn leaving his home village together with his best friend Etoh in search of adventure.

This version of Record of Lodoss War is a traditional Japanese RPG with top-down world map navigation and random battles. There is a strategic element in the battles, allowing the characters to freely move on the battle field. However, the battles can be set on auto, making them more fast-paced and similar to traditional Japanese RPG combat. The towns have menu-based first-person view navigation.</desc>

		<desc>Set in the Record of Lodoss War fantasy universe, created by the Japanese writer Ryo Mizuno, this game is based on the anime Chronicles of the Heroic Knight. The story focuses on a young man named Spark, who wants to become a knight of the country of Flaim. King Kashue needs Spark to prove himself worthy of this title, and tells him to gather a band of mercenaries and prepare to stop the dark wizard Wagnard's mysterious plans.

The gameplay is similar to the previous Record of Lodoss War game. Spark and his party roam the top-down world map, visiting towns, villages, and other locations on the way. Enemies appear randomly. The turn-based battles once again offer free movement on the screen, but as before, auto-battle feature can speed things up. Towns and other important locations are viewed as still screens from first-person perspective.</desc>

		<name>Renny Blaster</name>
		<desc>Renny Blaster is a beat-em-up in which the player can choose to control either the paranormal private investigator Fujiro Yarai, or a man with a mysterious past and supernatural abilities named Seishiro. The two characters have the same goal: prevent a secret organization of monsters and undead, run by a maniacal vampire, from taking control over Europe. The two characters begin with different initial stages, but continue on the same path afterwards. Seishiro is physically weaker and has a default ranged energy attack; Fujiro fights with regular punches and kicks. Both characters have access to unique elemental attacks that are activated by holding down a button. Most of the stages are straightforward side-scrolling action with boss battles at the end of each; a few areas contain light platforming elements.</desc>

As they go deeper and deeper they will find clues as to who ordered the kidnapping, the Sakazaki family's relation to the mob, and a person from their past.

The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.

The arcade version doesn't allow you to play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.</desc>

		<desc>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories. As the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes his father's face. As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast is a side-scrolling platformer. The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</desc>

		<name>Sherlock Holmes : Consulting Detective : Vol. I</name>
		<desc>In this game, the player is cast into the roles of Sherlock Holmes, the greatest fictional detective of all times, and his friend and partner Dr. Watson, as they have to investigate and successfully solve three criminal cases:
The Mummy's Curse deals with the horrifying death of three men, which were apparently murdered by an ancient mummy;

The Mystified Murderess involves a woman who has been convicted for murdering her beloved one, but cannot seem to recall anything of what had happened to her;

The Tin Soldier concerns the murder of an old general, whose past must be investigated in order to find the killer.Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective can be described as a hybrid of adventure game and simulation. Gameplay process involves traveling to various locations in London, interrogating suspects, gathering clues, checking out the newspapers, and eventually presenting all the evidence to the judge; if the latter finds the circumstances incriminating, he will accept the results of the investigation, and the case will be considered solved. Though the basic gameplay is rather typical for adventure games, the amount of real detective work and the focus of the game on purely case-related actions rather than exploration and manipulation of items makes it comparable to a simulation of a criminal investigation.

The game is notable for being one of the earliest "multimedia" titles, having been released on a CD ROM and featuring rather long (though windowed) video sequences with live actors as introductions and cutscenes, which frequently occur when the heroes investigate suspects.</desc>

- The same number of cases: 3

But, each situation is completely different: ?The Two Lions? involving the murder of circus lions, ?The Pilfered Paintings? just bought by The National Gallery...and ?The Murdered Munitions Magnate?, where hints reveal different possible motives...have nothing in common, except the detective in charge: you?</desc>

The most dangerous pirate crew is the one of Sol Bianca - April, Janny, May, June, and Feb. No, those are not names of months, but five beautiful ladies, who can handle some high-tech weaponry and who think only about treasure. But the five lovely pirates are not evil - whenever some tyrant threatens a planet, they are there to help.

The gameplay of  Sol Bianca is that of a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the five girls as a party, each one having individual statistics. The party of heroines visits planets, travels on the world map, and engages randomly appearing enemies in first-person perspective, turn-based combat.</desc>

It puts the player into a position of a high school teacher, whose goal is to successfully lead five female students to graduation within the same semester. In order to do that, the player has to study the individual characteristics of the girls. Each girl has different parameters, different strengths and weaknesses. The teacher should be careful not to overload the students with work, but letting them do what they want is not the right way either. The teacher has also control on other aspects of the students' life: it is possible to have personal conversations with the girls to motivate them, and choose leisure activities for them (such as going to the cinema). The girls can become displeased with the teacher or sick, so it's important to keep the morale high in order to achieve successful graduation.</desc>

You determine their class schedules, do guidance counseling, interfere with their weekend plans, and occasionally take to the streets to make sure they're not getting into trouble. Each of the girls have their own individual personality and problems, and the choices you make will determine whether they graduate from high school, what they do with their lives afterwards, and whether or not they wind up hating your guts. Get them all into top colleges and your boss will praise your genius. If they all flunk or wind up wanting to marry you, you'll obviously be fired.

Despite what common sense and knowledge of the Japanese psyche might lead you to believe, this is not an adult (or hentai) game and there's no nudity and only an average amount of anime sexploitation.</desc>

What remains is the classic mode that allows the player to choose the type of arcade cabinet (upright, black &amp; white, etc.) as background to the action as well as the versus mode for two players. The versus mode is split-screen, each player trying to survive and eliminate more invaders than the opponent.

The Game Boy version has both one- and two-player modes using the usual Game Boy tones (black and grey). However, plugging the cart into a Super Game Boy allows playing the game in all four cabinet types of the SNES version. 

The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version offers an additional "cosmic versus" mode, where the background is composed of anime-style pictures of girls. They also appear in the "omake mode", which is a single-player variant with the same backgrounds.

The WonderSwan version doesn't offer all four cabinet types (only black &amp; white) but keeps the versus mode.</desc>

With the help of Aria, princess of Menaris, Harry must discover the truth about Doran's intentions, and when he learns it, he realizes that he won't use the repaired ship to return home, but will have to face something that threatens the entire galaxy.

Star Breaker is a fairly traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down view, world map navigation, random turn-based battles, and all the other usual ingredients. Battles can be set on Auto for quicker pacing.

For that reason the difficulty in these modes is more forgiving; they allow more continues and have more generously placed power-ups. These modes also offer more destructible objects on the screen, as these specifically serve to increase the score.</desc>

The plants from the original PC Kid games are still here to provide such joys as extra firepower, fountains of smiley faces or the tiny-denjin which makes dodging bullets that little bit easier. Another handy little trick is that your boots also pack a punch, so backing into an enemy is more likely to dispose of them than do you any permanent damage. Part way along each of the levels you get the chance to rescue a friend who then joins with you, giving you a specific extra ability. These friends are pre-set one per level and cannot be chosen, and they allow things like rapid-sushi-fire and handy rear shots.</desc>

		<desc>Super Albatross is a golf game. There are three modes available: training, match play, and tournament. Match play is essentially a story mode that casts the player in the role of a young man whose mother has passed away and who tries to find solace in golf. In this mode, opponents must be defeated in a linear fashion and courses are dictated by the story. In training and tournament modes the player can choose between six different courses. The tournament mode is a competition between various characters who appeared as opponents in the match play mode. The golf game itself is viewed from a top-down perspective at all times, and allows the player to choose the type of club as well as adjust the angle and the strength of the shot.</desc>

		<path>./Super Schwarzschild (Japan).chd</path>
		<name>Super Schwarzschild</name>
		<desc>Super Schwarzschild is a spin-off entry in the Schwarzschild series. The game's scenario is based on that of Schwarzschild II. The story is much more elaborate and character-specific; unlike the earlier game, there is a linear plot advanced through dialogue and anime-style cutscenes. The player takes control of Alcion, the crown prince of the Auraclume kingdom, who is forced to terminate his studies abroad and return to his country in order to defend it against a treacherous enemy.

The gameplay system is vastly different as well; as opposed to the main entries in the series, Super Schwarzschild is not a grand strategy game. The gameplay is confined to much smaller areas and is also significantly more linear and mission-oriented. Rather than presenting free-form gameplay and interaction with a multitude of nations, the game is restricted to a single military conflict. Diplomacy options are completely gone; finances, resource management, and research have been simplified. Much of the game is dedicated to military strategy and tactics, involving arming and deploying ships. Battles are actively controlled by the player; they take place on separate small screens and require the player to navigate ships and attack enemy craft in turn-based fashion.</desc>

		<desc>The follow-up to Super Schwarzschild offers an original scenario that takes place after the Great Somari War. Like other Schwarzschild games, it is set in the 40th century and portrays a complex political and military situation within a star system. The events of the game take place in or around the once powerful kingdom of Istramu, which was severely weakened by the king's death. Temporary leaders replaced each other, and the instability led to a global revolt in the surrounding space. The player takes the role of various characters belonging to the resistance movement.

Like the previous game, Super Schwarzschild has less grand strategy elements than the main Schwarzschild installments, and focuses on smaller-scale military strategy and tactics. There are no diplomacy options; resource management and research are simplified. There are more belligerents and somewhat more freedom in strategic planning than in the preceding game. Battles take place on separate screens and follow a turn-based tactical model. Similarly to the predecessor, the game features extensive cutscenes and dialogue that advance the plot.</desc>

		<desc>In Terraforming, the human race has fled into the depths of space after Earth has become uninhabitable.  As a result, they travel from planet to planet in an attempt to find a planet suitable enough to terraform into a new Earth.  Along the way they encounter alien races which they must destroy in an attempt to survive and continue the human race.

The gameplay is a basic side-scrolling shooter, shooting down enemy space ships, picking up power-ups and health icons and upgrading main and secondary weapons along with the obligatory huge stage bosses.  The most notable feature of the game is the work done by Syd Mead, a special effects artist for such films as Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Blade Runner, Aliens, 2010 and as recent as Mission Impossible III.</desc>

		<desc>Sylphia is set in an environment inspired by the Greek mythology. The heroine of the game was a fearless maiden who tried to protect her home town from the onslaught of monsters. But even her power was no enough, and she was slain... Touched by her sacrifice, the goddess Athena revived her as a flying demi-goddess. Restored to new life, Sylphia can now unleash her wrath upon the monsters and their supporters.

Despite its theme and setting, Sylphia plays like a vertically scrolling shooter. As in most games of this kind, the gameplay consists of shooting down waves of enemies, on the ground and in the skies. Sylphia can use four types of ranged attacks, which roughly correspond to other shooters' traditional weapons: fire blasts, laser, spreading fire, homing missiles. These weapons are displayed as colored orbs and must be collected. Power-ups can be collected for each type of attack. In addition, a devastating special attack can be stored (for one charge) and executed.</desc>

		<name>Tenchi Muyou! Ryououki</name>
		<desc>Tenchi Muy?! Ry?-?ki is based on the manga and anime series Tenchi Muyo, in particular the 20-episode OVA Tenchi Muyo: Ryo-ohki (same name as the game, but with a slightly different official romanization). The story centers around a seemingly ordinary boy Tenchi Masaki, who lives in the countryside on the Earth. After accidentally releasing a spaced pirate named Ryoko, his modest house attracts the attention of powerful people from space, including an officer of the Galaxy Police, a famous scientist, and two sisters from a royal family in search of their long-lost half-brother. Soon Tenchi finds out the truth about his own identity and his super-powers, but still can't quite handle a household with five attractive young women, some of which seem to have a special interest in him...

The game is a traditional Japanese-style adventure: no puzzles, but many situations during which the player has to make choices. These choices lead to branching story lines, which in their turn lead to different endings. The game is viewed from first-person perspective, beside navigation around Tenchi's house, which uses a platform view.</desc>

		<name>Tenchi Wo Kurau</name>
		<desc>Originating in the arcades, Dynasty Wars is a beat-em-up set during the Three Kingdoms Era of the Chinese history, and is, more specifically, based on the Tenchi o Kurau manga adaptation of the story. The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers. 

Four historical characters from the time period can be controlled: Zhang Fei (fights with a halberd), Liu Bei (broadsword), Guan Yu (a Chinese pole weapon known as guan dao), and Zhao Yun (pike); some of the character names are misspelled in translated versions. The characters are distinguished by their health and strength parameters.

The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his weapon up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be. In addition, so-called "tactics" can be used at specific moments; these are powerful area attacks that deplete the protagonist's HP in process and range from summoning an ambush partner and causing rocks slide down slopes.

Stages typically culminate in boss battles. Along the way, various power-ups can be collected. Besides treasure that increases the player's score, and food packs that heal the protagonist, there are also yellow and blue orbs, which represent the game's light RPG elements: yellow orbs count as experience points and increase the character's vitality after a stage is over, and blue orbs increase the power of his weapon.</desc>

One day, following a monster attack on the village, Eple and her penguin friend fell into the water and drifted to faraway lands. The duo must face fearsome enemies and dangers to find a way back home.

Travel Eple is a top-down action game similar in concept to Bomberman. The game is divided into stages, each consisting of one screen. Every stage has an opponent who tries to kill Eple either by attacking directly (most regular enemies only have close-range attacks, but bosses may not follow this rule), or by throwing objects at her. Eple, on the other hand, has no attacks on her own and must rely on these objects (mostly explosives such as bombs and grenades) to hurt the enemy. Objects keep appearing randomly in various parts of the screen as long as the battle continues.

Stages may contain hazardous areas that damage Eple, or other spots that prevent her from walking around normally. Health-restoring pots also pop up from time to time. A few stages require Eple to access a magic staff, which grants her various protective abilities (e.g. an ice force field that absorbs fire damage). 

A versus mode is available, in which players compete against each other by controlling Eple and her friend Pal. Their magical abilities can be customized before the battle begins.</desc>

		<desc>Urusei Yatsura: Stay with You is based on the manga series by Rumiko Takahashi. The protagonist is Ataru Moroboshi, a high school student who accidentally evokes love in the heart of Lum, the princess of an alien demon-like race. The game does not recount the initial events of the manga and instead is built like an episode, assuming the player's familiarity with the general story and characters. Ataru's ex-girlfriend Shinobu disappears under mysterious circumstances. Ataru and Lum must explore the high school building and find out what happened to Shinobu.

The gameplay is that of a traditional Japanese-style adventure, where all interaction (including navigation) is performed by selecting verb commands from a menu and combining them with objects from a list. game progression is fairly linear, and it is typically required to complete an objective in one location in order to be able to proceed to the next one. There are no real puzzles, but an inventory with items that can be examined is present.</desc>

Gameplay-wise, this version differs from the computer releases significantly. Though it has six stages that end with the same boss enemies, its level design, layout, and many regular enemies are different. This release also completely removes two key gameplay features of the computer version: the ability to equip different weapons and armor, and the flying side-scrolling shooter stages. </desc>

But a new threat has arisen: an enigmatic man named Glames from the Dark World, possessor of a sword named Leethus, is planning to conquer both Earth and Vecanti, convinced that there is no other way to save his world from imminent destruction. A young girl from the Dark World named Cham escapes from Glames, and asks Yuko to help her stop him with the aid of her Valis sword.

Like its predecessors in the series, Valis III is a side-scrolling platform action game. Unlike the previous installments, the player can control three characters in the game: Yuko, Cham (who uses a whip and fights similarly to Castlevania protagonists), and princess Valna from Vecanti, who is weaker physically, but can cast more powerful magic. Each of the characters can equip different weapons and has access to her own magic spells.</desc>

The prince was imprisoned, but managed to break free, kidnap Valna, the queen of Vecanti, and install himself as the Dream Land's new ruler. Cham, the leader of the resistance against Galgear, hears the voice of Yuko, the former Valis soldier who has now become a goddess, telling her that one of the resistance members, a girl named Lena, is the heir to the Valis sword. Lena and her sister Amu decide to rescue Valna and find a way to stop Galgear.

Like its predecessors, Valis IV is an action platformer. It is similar to the previous game in allowing the player to control three different characters: Lena, Amu, and Asfal. Each of the characters wields a unique weapon (Valis sword for Lena, boomerang for Amu, and lance trident for Asfal) and has access to their own elemental spells (thunder for Lena, fire for Amu, ice for Asfal). Each one also has a special ability: Lena can slide through narrow passages, Amu can double-jump, and Asfal is immune to certain traps. Along with recovery and spell-enhancing (up to three levels) items, characters can also acquire special spheres that increase the overall count of their hit- and magic points.</desc>

The game has three modes: exhibition, team management, and new player debut. Exhibition mode allows the player to select from a wide variety of wrestlers and compete in single, double, or tag-team (six wrestlers) fashions. New player debut puts the player in the role of popular wrestlers from the franchise, taking them through training sessions and a series of matches.

Team management is the game's most expansive mode. In this mode, the player assumes the role of a manager who has to assemble a team of wrestlers to compete in Japanese regional leagues. New wrestlers can be picked from known athletes, or "scouted" on the street, with varied effects. The player then assigns schedules and activities for the wrestlers. It is possible to talk to them, send them on vacations, and also fire them. The player can also renovate the gym, design masks for the wrestlers, handle public relations, and perform other management duties. All these activities cost action points and have to be handled with care before the team is challenged for competition.</desc>

		<desc>Tenka wa Ware ni is based on the Sangokushi manga by Mitsuteru Yokoyama, itself an adaptation of Eiji Yoshikawa's re-telling of the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. As such, the game includes plot elements and a few characters added by Yoshikawa or Yokoyama, but for the most part remains faithful to the general storyline of the Chinese novel and hence to the actual historical events of the Three Kingdoms Era.

The gameplay is similar to that of Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, focusing on grand strategy and country management as well as on tactical battles. There is no scenario selection, but the player can choose between multiple warlords of the three kingdoms. The player then manages the province under control of the selected warlord. It is necessary to take care of the population and army, buying provisions, training officers, and publishing edicts. Diplomacy plays an important role: pacts and agreements can be made, and it is also possible to acquire new allies through various means.

Invading (or being attacked by) another country leads to a large-scale tactical battle that takes place on hexagonal grids. The player navigates army divisions in turn-based fashion. Contact with an enemy division leads to yet another sub-mode, where the player controls units that form the division, positioning and navigating them on a smaller battle screen. The game also has a separate battle mode accessible from the main menu, where the player can recreate historical battles directly without going through grand strategy portions.</desc>

The two games share the same basic story, but have many differences regarding concrete events, locations, gameplay details, etc. The events of the game take place a short while after those described in Ys II, and before the events of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys.

As the game begins, Adol and his friend return to the town of Minea, where the first game began. The evil Lord Darm has been defeated, and it's time to relax and spend some time with friends - but not for long. A new evil is rising, and Adol decides to set sail for the overseas land of Celceta to investigate these occurrences.

Ys IV returns to the style of play used in the first and second games. The gameplay area is viewed from a top-down perspective, and the player attacks enemies by running into them to cause damage. Combat is slightly more sophisticated than in the first two games, since Adol can now move in eight directions, and attacking enemies diagonally or from the sides is more efficient than bumping into them headstrong. Adol gains experience from defeating enemies, which serves to raise his attack and defense power, like in the previous games. He can equip various swords, armor, shields, and rings to enhance his attributes. The magic system introduced in Ys II is also brought back for this game.</desc>

Part-time jobs now include delivery assignments that play like overhead racing games, as well as tending to dogs of various breeds for money. The security guard assignment plays like a mini-RPG, complete with turn-based combat, experience points, and levels. In addition, it is possible to visit racing tracks and bet money on participants. The versus mode allows players to choose between three courses to compete in, racing against each other (in a top-down mode) or computer AI (first-person).</desc>

		<name>Zero Wing</name>
		<desc>Zero Wing is an horizontal shooter game where the player is in control of a ZIG, an escape pod released after its main ship was attacked and destroyed by the evil cyborg CATS, bent on taking over the world.

Like most games in the genre, there are three color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) and blue (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.

The game (more precisely, the European PAL version of it) is known for being the origin of the grammatically incorrect phrase in the English translation, All your base are belong to us, which has since become an internet phenomenon. </desc>

		<name>3x3 Eyes : Sanjiyan Henjyo</name>
		<desc>Sanjiyan Henj? is based on the manga and anime series 3x3 Eyes. Pai, a young girl from the immortal tribe of sanzhiyan, three-eyed demons of Chinese origin, wants to become a human again. She meets a Japanese teenager named Yakumo Fujii, whom she accidentally turns into a "wu", an immortal obedient servant of a three-eyed demon. Together, Pai and Yakumo try to regain their lost humanity.

This game can be considered a side-story to the series. The player does not control Yakumo, but an ordinary high-school student named Kenichi Yamamoto. Accidentally, Kenichi comes into contact with the world of demons, and now he needs the help of Pai and Yakumo to be freed. 

The gameplay is standard Japanese-style adventure. The player interacts with the game world by selecting menu commands "Look", "Talk", and "Move". The game features animated cutscenes and (in its console incarnation) voice-overs.</desc>

		<desc>The story of Advanced V.G. follows a similar template as those of the previous  Variable Geo games: the strongest young women in the country hold a tournament, which is sponsored by various restaurant chains, which in turn ask the competing girls to pose as waitresses working in said restaurants, for promotional purposes. The girls of the Jahana group who starred in the previous games return, with the new main protagonist being the young martial artist Yuka Takeuchi, who has been training in a secluded forest area before joining the competition. 

Like its predecessors, Advanced V.G. is a fighting game, with the basic "kick" and "punch" moves, while the various special attacks are executed by pressing combinations of buttons. There are three modes in the game, "Normal", "Vs.", and "Story". The normal mode is basically training matches between the player character and an AI-controlled girl. Vs. mode allows two-player mode, as well as demo "computer vs. computer" gameplay, with the possibility to choose any of the stages. Any of the nine heroines is available as a playable character in these modes (Yuka Takeuchi, Chiho Masuda, Jun Kubota, Manami Kusunoki. Kaori Yanase, Reimi Jahana, Satomi Yajima, Ayako Y?ki, and Erina Goldsmith). The story mode, on the other hand, allows the player to control Yuka Takeuchi only, and follow her story. Cut scenes advance the story between matches. 

The SNES received a stripped-down version, Super V.G., without the Story Mode and all explicit hentai elements. Hybrids (pair of bosses in Advanced V.G.) were also removed.</desc>

		<desc>The two sisters, Ai and Yuuko, have taken different paths in life. Yuuko has been taken away by a mysterious gang. Ai is determined to save her from the clutches of crime. In a seemingly all-female city overrun by insane workers, biker gangs, and assorted criminals, Ai and her friends Chika and Makoto decide to work together in order to restore the world to normality again.

Ane-san is what is commonly called beat-'em-up, i.e. a fighting game that allows limited movement through side-scrolling environment. The player can choose to control a variety of female fighters. In the beginning, only Ai, Chika, and Makoto are selectable. Ai is the all-around balanced character, Chika is fast and fragile, while Makoto is very strong, but slow. Later in the game, other playable characters become available. Each fighter has a health points bar, which can be restored by healing items scattered through the levels. Once a character is dead, the player can continue playing with another one.

The player typically advances through side-scrolling stages, clearing each screen of enemies before being able to continue walking to the right. Each girl has the standard kicks, punches, and jumps at her disposal, as well as special moves, one per each girl. Stages culminate by boss battles (usually two per stage). 

Between the stages, the player can go shopping. A large variety of items is available, some enhancing the performance of the girls, but most purely for visual effect - the room the player views between the stages changes its appearance depending on the items the player has bought.

Also available between the stages (and as a separate gameplay mode, "vs.") is a mini-game, in which the player(s) have to rapidly press buttons in order to make the controllable girl execute a hideous grimace, that will surpass that of the opponent in ugliness and speed of execution.</desc>

Unlike the first Shadowgate, this is a platform game - not an action game, but a classical point-and-click adventure viewed from a platform perspective. You can move your hero around, examine, manipulate, and take objects. You can also duck and have a "punch" command. Find the correct solutions to the game's puzzles, otherwise a gruesome death awaits you!</desc>

Afterwards, they began producing giant combat robots, evidently prepared to build an entire army and become the most dominant military power on the Earth. It's time to stop them! The young hero, piloting a giant combat robot of his own, is sent to Sea Square precisely for that reason...

Browning is a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls the giant robot, equipped with a single gun (with unlimited ammunition), and must fight waves of enemies (mostly of a robotic kind), and eventually the stage boss. Short cut scenes appear between the stages. The player-controlled robot has the ability to hover in the air (the player has to repeatedly press a button to make the robot keep the height). The hit points of the robot depend on the condition of its shield. When the robot stands still, shield energy recharges slowly. Complete loss of shield energy makes the robot so vulnerable that the next hit destroys it. The player is given unlimited continues, but must return to the beginning of the stage each time the robot is destroyed.</desc>

Seventeen years later, Sayaka, the young heiress of the Asano family, forms a group together with her friends Miki and Kyoko, and the three begin looking for the lost treasure. Heist after heist goes by unsuccessfully. Eventually, the girls organize a TV show, challenging dubious personalities to card games, hoping to find the Sorcerer's Trump in process.

Cardangels is a card game in which the player takes the roles of the three friends, playing cards against young, attractive female opponents. Four types of card games are available: poker, blackjack, speed, and babanuki (a variant of old maid). A slot machine-like introduction determines which games are played against which opponents. The player can select the amount of rounds (minimum ten) needed to win a game and advance to the next opponent. The "free play" mode allows the player to choose the type of game actively, but the amount of available opponents is lower. There is no gambling in any of the games; points are awarded for combinations in poker and blackjack. The opponents undress after losing a game; however, they retain their underwear - there is no explicit nudity in the game.</desc>

Each stage consists of a rotatable 3D screen containing a number of poles of the same height. Players take turns in placing balls onto these poles. Adjacent balls (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) can be "captured" and hence change their color. Points are awarded per ball of each color. The round ends when there is no more place on the poles to put balls onto, and the player with the most points wins.

The story mode begins with an introduction depicting a powerful demon that can only be vanquished by traveling to the Color World; a young pilot ventures there and must defeat opponents in the Color Wars game at each stage. This mode puts one player against three AI-controlled opponents; the free mode also allows four human players to compete against each other. Two-player mode can be played by either two human players or one player against computer AI.</desc>

The young fighter Hawk has his own score to settle with the Dragon Zone: they have kidnapped his girlfriend Candy. Together with his friend, the punk Tony, Hawk enters the dangerous districts and is determined to rescue his sweetheart and put an end to the organization.

Riot Zone (Crest of Wolf in Japan) is a rather simple brawler in which the player can choose to control either Hawk or Tony. Hawk is faster, but doesn't hit quite as hard as Tony. Both characters fight entirely unarmed, using kicks and punches to deal with the enemies; both also possess a powerful all-screen attack that depletes a portion of their health bar. Each stage culminates with a boss battle as Hawk and Tony gradually defeat the "wanted" criminals of the city.</desc>

		<desc>Dekoboko Densetsu is a humorous game that combines elements of arcade action and racing. Up to five players can compete in the races. All the stages are vertically-scrolling (top-down), with the cars represented as small sprites of different colors. The player's goal is not only to beat the other cars, but also reach the finish line safely: each car has limited hit points, and continuously receives damage during the race.

Damage can be sustained by driving over environmental hazards (pits, traps, bombs, etc.), failing to move the car forward in time (if the screen scrolls while the player-controlled car is at the bottom, it takes damage), being hit by the many enemies encountered in the game (which include a wide variety of wild animals, humans, fantasy creatures, monsters, etc.), or being hit by a competing car. Cars have the ability to jump over obstacles or enemy fire, avoiding damage.

Over the course of the races, cars accumulate points depending on their results. These points can be invested in purchasing a limited amount of destructive weaponry (missiles, bombs, "boxing glove" that hits enemies from the side, oil to drop behind the car, etc.) or protective measures.</desc>

The boy has to go to the new school, but his mind is preoccupied with one subject only: pretty girls. Instead of studying hard, Takurou decides to explore the city and to find out more about its female inhabitants.

D?ky?sei is more interactive than most other Japanese adventures, utilizing point-and-click interface (with context-sensitive icons for talking, touching, etc.) and featuring free top-down navigation through the town and the school building. The hero can enter restaurants, shops, cafe houses, etc. It is also possible to take a train to another district and explore it. The game has an internal clock; a visit to any location (including separate rooms of a building, etc.) "costs" twenty minutes of the game time. 

The purpose of the game is to learn where and when the fourteen "datable" girls usually are. Many of the conversations with the girls feature multiple answers; the success in many cases depends on the player's choices.

The game has scenes with nudity and explicit sexual situations.</desc>

Despite the abundance of pretty girls, there are no explicit sex scenes in this game.

In the game, Tomomi is just a simple girl who works in a restaurant, but gets magically transported to a fairy land. There, she must first protect the inhabitants of a peaceful town from goblin onslaught, and ultimately find a way to return to the real world. 

Despite the top-down view and the fact it was developed y the same  company who have brought us distinguished Turbo CD RPGs such as  Cosmic Fantasy series and  Babel, Meiky? no Elfeane is not a RPG, but an adventure - Japanese-style, with minimum puzzles. Most of the gameplay involves running around and talking to various inhabitants of the fairy world. There are also mini-games: a  Pac-Man-like game with cars, a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up, a  Breakout clone, and a quiz show.</desc>

You fly left-to-right mostly, with occasional vertically-scrolling sections, and use several different weapon styles to defeat your many foes. Along with Esty in her ship the "Wild Cat", you must defeat the forces of General Don Jingi, who has plans of taking energy from the star of Aries.

Playing as the pilot Hawk, players must avoid collisions and weapon-fire from the General's "Obellon" army. Consisting of many different types of enemy, the army has a massive, sprawling force of guns, turret, ships, battle-stations and mech-type units. Their fire-power is immense and you are the single opposing force!

Gate of Thunder allows players to choose in real-time from three weapon-fire types. A blue-coloured electrical fire, a green-coloured wave-fire, and a red-coloured quake-type fire. Along with this, players obtain homing-missiles and the assistance of the "Wild Cat" which orbits the ship separately. Gate of Thunder also features a critically acclaimed soundtrack that remains a talking-point to this day.</desc>

		<desc>This interpretation of the famous giant monster from the Japanese cinematic industry takes form of a fighting game, only instead of the usual brave martial artists the players control horrifying monsters from the traditional  Toho lineage: the titular beast itself, Rodan, Anguirus, Ghidorah, and others. The game has two modes: Normal and Vs. The latter is essentially a two-player mode, which allows the players to engage in giant monster battles in a variety of scenarios. Most of the monsters, however, are locked in the Vs. mode before the player has completed the Normal mode.

The Normal mode puts the player in control of Godzilla, who has to go through five stages before reaching the final boss. Each stage has two battles against two different creatures in two different locations, from which the player has to complete only one in order to proceed to the next stage. Depending on the player's performance, points are awarded; in order to be able to compete against different final bosses, the player has to accumulate more points. If the player only has the minimum required points, only one final boss will be available.

The combat system is similar to other fighting games, with various combinations of buttons executing different moves. Naturally, the normal "punch-kick" scheme is modified to suit the monsters' shapes and biological peculiarities. For example, monsters with tails can use tail spin attacks; fire-breathing monsters have a range fire attack, etc. Most of the monsters (including Godzilla) have a move when they hold the opponent and suck its blood. </desc>

It became increasingly hard to maintain them, and special robots known as "Bidroids" were invented to do the hard work. However, the colonies began waging war on each other, and Bidroids were used for military purposes. When peace was finally achieved, the leaders decided that Bidroids could continue functioning as combat machines, but in friendly championships rather than in deadly wars. 

Hyper Wars is primarily a managerial simulation; robot combat itself is calculated depending on how the player created and maintained his or her robots. The player controls a manager of a team which competes in a league, complete with schedules, stadiums, etc. The player is given an initial budget with which he or she is able to create the first robot models and train them. Each robot can be created by merging together various parts ("human", "beast", "bird", and so on). After creation, it is necessary to outfit the robot with weapons and upgrade its parameters by paying for training. When the player feels ready, the robots can be taken to combat arenas and participate in the tournament.</desc>

It doesn't have a developed story; rather, it tells background stories of the ten fighters the player can control in the game: Jenius, Asasin, Arcer (sic to all three), Samohan, Greeze, Orga, Lobo, Blocken, Jyobei and Daibuster. The only time the background story is told is when the player selects a fighter in the story mode. Usually, the five "good" fighters have to face the five "evil" ones one after the other (each in different order) if selected in the story mode. Though the game's intro states that it is less about who is good and who is evil, and more about who is the better fighter...

The gameplay is for the most part traditional fighting game-style (with the obligatory two-player battle mode as an option to the linear story mode); an important difference is the fact that some of the characters use swords and other weapons, rather than fight with their bare hands. The traditional "kick" and "punch" buttons are called "short attack" and "long attack" here; their execution is unique to each fighter.</desc>

Controlling Areios, the player explores the top-down world, visiting towns and fighting monsters in vast outdoor areas and dungeons. Like in Ys series, it is sufficient to "bump" into a monster in order to inflict damage. Areios gains hit points and becomes stronger by sustaining damage from enemies and resting. His weapons and armor can gain experience and level up. In many areas, companions will join Areios and help him in combat, controlled by the computer AI.

The game is divided into chapters; the final stage of each chapter is a side-scrolling/platform level, which Areios has to navigate in order to reach the boss enemy, defeat him, and end the chapter. In such stages, the combat turns into a more familiar action-oriented style, with the player being required to press buttons in time in order to execute attacks and jump.

There is a day/night cycle in the game, manifested not only in graphical changes, but also in the schedules of townspeople: when it's dark, people will return to their homes and go to sleep, etc.</desc>

		<name>Ko Seiki Beast Sanjuushi - Gaia Fukkatsu Kanketsu-hen</name>
		<desc>This release walks a fine line between an updated version and a full remake of  KO Seiki Beast Sanj?shi: Gaia no Fukkatsu. The game follows the same story for the most part, and contains the cut scenes from the original version. Like most PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD games, it features voice acting during cut scenes and CD audio tracks.

Several cut scenes were added, and some dialogues expanded. Though the story progression and the areas the characters have to traverse in order to advance it remain intact most of the time, the gameplay system has received an overhaul, being essentially developed from scratch. The "RPG-lite" feel of the original version is now somewhat compensated by the ability to equip weapons and armor, as in most RPGs. Combat engine has also been modified; instead of the isometric battle screens of the original, the battles are now viewed from "over-the-shoulder" third-person perspective, with player-controlled characters visibly attacking the foes, similarly to  Phantasy Star IV.</desc>

		<name>Magicoal</name>
		<desc>The boy Rhun and the girl Melvy live in a quiet forest village, both studying the art of magic. They enjoy a peaceful life, learning the secrets of the spirits and magical creatures populating the area. But on one fateful night, everything changes. A horde of goblins invades the village, burning it down. And it looks like the local church is in cohorts with a powerful demon bent on destruction! Before the heroes can realize what is happening, they are forced to escape into the forest, with only their magical powers at their side...

Magicoal is a "pseudo-RPG", i.e. an action-adventure with some minor RPG elements (money, items, etc.), but without an experience system of any kind. It can be played in two-player cooperative mode, controlling Rhun and Melvy, or as a single-player game, choosing one of them and letting the computer AI control the other. The player(s) can switch between the two at any time.

Most of the game is dedicated to exploring top-down areas populated by enemies, and dealing with them in action-based combat, primarily relying on magical spells. While some of the spells have unlimited use, others must be "refilled" with special items found or dropped by the enemies. Rhun and Melvy learn spells unique to each character, of various elemental affinities and general usage (offensive, support, etc.). Money can be collected from enemies as well and then used in shops to buy items.</desc>

		<name>Mashou Denki - La Valeur</name>
		<desc>In this game, the player controls a swordsman named Alan. One day he arrives at the village of Flodi, and finds out that his help is needed: the daughter of the village elder, Sophia, has been kidnapped by monsters and taken into the nearby cave. Naturally, rescuing Sophia is just the first quest among the many perils that await the hero on his journey...

La Valeur is a RPG that mostly follows the Japanese format: the hero wanders through the top-down locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat, gaining money and experience, leveling up automatically, and advancing the story in a linear fashion. 

However, there are also some less traditional features in the game. There are three classes of weapons, distinguished by the type of damage they inflict: slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning. Different types of enemies are strong/weak against different classes of weapons. Magic is learned by obtaining keys from wizards in various towns, searching the surrounding areas for treasure chests, retrieving magic rings of different kinds from them, and then bringing them back to the wizard to learn new spells.

The entire quest is played solo, without party members. There is no "world map", which is characteristic for other games of this kind. The gameplay is heavy on "level-grinding"; typically, a certain level must be reach in a given area before the hero is able to defeat the boss enemy. After having reached this level, regular enemies of that area stop giving experience points.</desc>

		<name>Mateki Densetsu Astralius</name>
		<desc>It was just an ordinary cruise ship gig for the four musicians. The band leader, known only as the Flute (the player names him and the other heroes before the game begins), never thought that it will end in such a way... Suddenly, a tornado engulfed the ship, and the poor musician found himself in the magical world populated by angelic creatures and monsters! Naturally, this world, called Astralius by its inhabitants, needs salvation. Only the Magic Flute can avert a demonic threat. Apparently, our hero is the only flutist in all the dimensions, since it is now his task to take the unlikely role of a noble paladin, find other musicians to help him on his quest, and show everyone that music can, indeed, save the world!

Despite the somewhat unusual choice of protagonists, Mateki Densetsu Astralius is quite an "old-school" Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the nameless flutist and other musicians (trumpet player, drummer, etc.), who later join the party, exploring the top-down world, visiting towns to buy weapons, armor, and items, descending into dungeons, automatically leveling up, progressing the story in a linear fashion, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Casting magic spells is called "performing" in the game, though it requires magic points, like in other games of this kind. Those magic points must be bought in special shops.

Unlike most other PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD RPGs, there are no voice overs or animated cut scenes in this game.</desc>

		<name>Metamor Jupiter</name>
		<desc>The plot of Metamor Jupiter is simple: a biological mutation causes an alien race to spread all over the galaxy. Armed with advanced technology, the aliens sent their machines and robots to face humanity in a cosmic battle. To counter that, the humans draw from the newly discovered crystal energy to deploy a unit of powerful fighter crafts, which can change their shapes in an instant, adapting to every situation.

The player controls one of such crafts, and has to fly and shoot his way through side-scrolling levels populated by regular enemies, bosses, and various types of hazards. Other fighters will accompany the player-controlled machine from time to time, but they usually don't survive the robotic onslaught, and the player character is left to fend for himself. 

As the premise implies, the defining feature of the game is the fighter craft's ability to change shapes. The three main variations have two weapons each, which are suited for different situations. For example, one of the forms has vertical fire, but lacks powerful explosives; another can drop bombs, but has a slow forward beam attack, etc. Each of the forms can gather power-ups, which will strengthen the conventional weapons.

Unlike most shooters of this kind, there are no "lives"; instead, the player-controlled  plane has a set amount of hit points, parts of which are depleted when it gets hit. Hit points can be restored by catching power-ups scattered across the levels.</desc>

		<desc>Hiwako, the daughter of a convenience store owner in a little Japanese town, is just an ordinary Japanese teenager - actually a bit of a spoiled brat. Or so she thought, until one day, a talking bird named Nike (like the Greek goddess of victory, not like the footwear brand) told her that she possessed unique powers that made her transform into the glorious lady warrior Artemis. No, Hiwako didn't stop being a spoiled brat; but as Artemis, it is now her duty to protect her home town from a demonic invasion, and she does not intend to give up.

Moonlight Lady can be called a "pseudo-RPG"; its top-down view and town exploration make it look like a representative of the Japanese branch of this genre, but in reality, it is an action game with light adventure elements and no true role-playing system. 

Throughout most of the game, the player controls Artemis and two other heroines (Aquarius and Minerva). Attacking is performed by pressing a button for the lead character's attack, and another for a simultaneous attack by the two other girls. The player can switch the leader at any time. The girls can also charge their attacks to execute more powerful ones.

Regular enemies populate the dungeons, but there is no reward (in the role-playing sense of this word) in defeating them; in fact, the player can try to avoid them altogether and head straight to the boss battle.

A few items can be found and used throughout the game, but there is no real weapon and armor management, nor a financial system of any kind.</desc>

Before each race you can buy a full compliment of upgrades and weapons, with each area (engine, handling, turbo and so on) having several variably-priced options. The unusual thing about the racing system is that the action always follows the leader. If you slip too far behind, your car is blown up and placed back onto the track further on in order to keep up (similarly to Micro Machines). This can only happen a limited number of times before the game is over.</desc>

The game consists of three "worlds", each with ten screens; on every screen, four ducks are competing against each other in collecting eggs and delivering their babies home. The ducks can be controlled by human players or by computer AI. Eggs are being dropped into the maze-like stage; the goal is to collect as many of them as possible. Once collected, an egg follows the duck, and after a while a baby would hatch and return home safely.

Each duck tries to sabotage the work of other ducks by placing fried eggs on their paths. In addition, various hazards and enemies keep appearing, trying to impede the ducks' progress. Ducks can be knocked down, paralyzed, and robbed of their eggs.</desc>

Recently, a powerful demon took control of the land, and some humans began using the art of baseball for evil purposes. The malevolent Dark Baseballer has been terrorizing innocents, and it is up to a group of young people to restore justice.

Nekketsu Legend Baseballer is a role-playing game dedicated to baseball. There is no actual baseball simulation in the game: much of it plays like a traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down overworld, town and dungeon explorations, party management, leveling up, equipment, items, etc. However, all the usual RPG paraphernalia is completely baseball-themed. Random turn-based battles occur less frequently than in other comparable games, but last a considerable amount of time due to their mechanics: each party member is in control of a group of "baseball robots", and defensive and offensive actions are named after real baseball moves.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2012 an alien armada attacked the Earth. Two young pilots were in the midst of a battle, and one of them, a lovely young woman, was killed. Three years later, the surviving pilot finally got a chance to avenge her death. Navigating a powerful new fighter ship named "Slasher", the pilot ventured into space, ready to bring destruction to those who took so much away from him.

Nexzr is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up similar to Super Star Soldier. The player-controlled spaceship starts with a simple vulcan gun that can only shoot straight. Various power-ups can either enhance the strength of this gun, replace it with a laser weapon, or add a secondary weapon (homing fire, thin spreading laser attacks, etc.), which is activated automatically. Mid- and end-level bosses are encountered on nearly every stage. Additional lives can be collected, but the player always restarts from the beginning of the stage when his fighter craft is destroyed.</desc>

The player is able to construct robots using various parts: body, limbs, computer AI, weapons, etc. The result can be a combination of any forms and components, with the limitation being the overall weight of the robot, which must not exceed a specified amount. Robots can be humanoid, machine-like, rolling on wheels, able to fly or transform into different forms, etc.

After a robot has been created, the player sends it to fight other robots. The battles look like those of a fighting game, with side-scrolling view and HP bars; however, they are non-interactive. The entire gameplay focus in on creating a robot in such a way that it would be able to defeat a particular enemy; the battles themselves allow no control from the side of the player.

A "league mode" is also available, where the player(s) choose various models of robots and have them compete against each other in a tournament.</desc>

One of the female crew members unexpectedly faints and is taken by her friends into an abandoned mansion discovered nearby. Very soon, however, the accident begins to repeat itself, and evidence of a gruesome murder and possible ghostly presence in the mansion surfaces. Mei Star, an investigator with the team, and her computerized holographic assistant Navi must solve the mystery before it becomes too late.

Private eye dol is an adventure game played for the most part from a top-down perspective. The player navigates Mei around the playable environment, examines places and items of interest, and talks to other characters. With a few exceptions, there are no puzzles in the game, and the plot is advanced by triggering events. On several occasions items must be picked up, but they are used automatically in correspondent locations.</desc>

The player can select any of the four characters before each stage. The characters are distinguished by the unique attacks of their ships: Alex uses a vulcan gun, Charr has short-ranged "psychic" beam, Joe has a slow, yet powerful Hell Flame attack, and Nastasia uses ion laser. Each character can also acquire additional weapons by picking regular power-ups.

The game's stand-out feature, however, is its transformation mode. Each of the characters can transform to a larger and much more powerful biomechanical insect-like ship. The transformation can be performed at any time as long as the correspondent bar, which refills itself over the time, is not empty. The bar is reduced rapidly when the character is transformed; special power-ups can be collected from vanquished enemies to extend it temporarily, but once it is depleted the character transforms back to his or her normal form.</desc>

		<name>Ranma 1/2</name>
		<desc>Based on the popular manga/anime series of the same name, Ranma 1/2 follows the story of an aspiring martial artist who accidentally turns into a young woman by bathing in a cursed spring. He can revert to his natural form by touching hot water; however, contact with cold water will turn him into a girl again. Most of the original manga story is dedicated to semi-comical situations, based on the fact that Ranma is trying to conceal his predicament, which leads to misunderstandings, confusion, and romantic complications in his high school life.

This interpretation of the license follows a part of the initial manga story, starting with the curse and going through Ranma's first conflicts with schoolmates and rival martial artists. The game is mostly structured like a "beat-'em-up" side-scroller, though there are also several boss fights that are more reminiscent of a one-on-one fighting game. The Vs. mode allows the player to recreate these boss fights using different characters. 

Ranma's curse becomes a gameplay feature in the game: cold and hot water turn Ranma into a girl and a boy, respectively. Female Ranma is quicker and can jump higher, but her attack and defense are lower. Anime-style cut scenes advance the story between the levels.</desc>

The player controls a car from an "into the screen" 3rd person perspective, racing through the 17 pseudo-3D courses (named after various geographical locations, e.g. "West Coast" etc.). There are other cars on the road, which can slow down the player-controlled car by colliding with it, but the race is against time rather than against these cars. The player is given a time limit for each course, and an indicator shows how close the car is to the completion. Should the car run out of time, the race is lost, and the player has to replay it before tackling the next one.

The car can be controlled with two buttons only; collisions do not damage the car, but merely make it stop; though the player can change a car model and gear system, no realistic gear-based driving is used in the game. All this contribute to the overall arcade feeling of the races.</desc>

The young swordsman Jan lives In the kingdom of Cordelia. One fine day he and Ortena, the daughter of the High Priest, go on a treasure hunt. When they return, they find the country overrun by monsters; Ortena's father is killed, and the princess of Cordelia has been kidnapped. The two team up with a legendary hero, in order to rescue those who can still be rescued, and fulfill the legacy of the gods...

Ruin: Kami no Isan is an action RPG. The player navigates Jan through top-down towns and hostile areas; the "world map" is not free-roaming, allowing only linear advancement from location to location. Hostile areas are populated by enemies who are visibly walking on screen. 

Unlike most Japanese RPGs, there are no separate "battle screens" in the game; the monsters are fought on the same spot they are encountered on, like in action games. However, unlike most action RPGs, there is a party in Ruin. The player controls only Jan, while the other party members act according to AI routines: attacking, casting offensive and healing spells, etc. 

The rest of the gameplay is traditional Japanese RPG style: acquiring better weapons and armor, automatic leveling up, linear story development, etc.</desc>

There is no scenario selection, and the exact timeline is not specified, though the initial situation corresponds to the phase of the war when Liu Bei and Cao Cao were the principal opposing forces. Players can choose to control any of the six most renowned warlords of the time, Liu Bei being the "default" player character with his own extended introduction and personal motives reminiscent of Luo Guanzhong's novelization of the historical events.

Each warlord tries to gain dominance by building up diplomatic relationships and invading other provinces. It is possible to send offerings and diplomatic missions to other rulers, as well as manage army commanders, finances, and provision. Invasions take place on a tactical hexagonal grid, on which the player positions his forces and navigates them in turn-based fashion. When opponents meet on adjacent fields an automatic battle sequence ensues.</desc>

Depending on the game mode, you are either cooperating or competing with your "friend" to find and get to an exit first.

		<desc>Snatcher is set in the futuristic Neo Kobe City, a city of madness and decadence. The year is 2047 (or 2042, according to the original Japanese version). Mankind is facing its gravest crisis. A mysterious bio-roid life form has appeared. Its true nature and purpose are unknown. Is it some country's secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and can sweat and even bleed. They are called "Snatchers" because they "snatch" their victims before they take their place.

A new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs (which is deciphered as "Japanese Undercover Neuro-Kinetic Elimination Rangers" in the English version). Every time you encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked ? is it a person or a snatcher? 

The player takes control of Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. The gameplay largely follows the structure of a Japanese-style adventure. The player uses a menu-driven interface to execute commands, which include moving between locations and interacting with the environment. Typically, every room contains objects that can be examined, leading to text descriptions and comments. Conversations occupy a large portion of the gameplay, with various topics available and a wealth of information about the game's world and characters. A few parts contain light puzzle-solving elements, though as a rule the game is almost completely devoid of puzzles.

During key moments of the narrative, the player will be prompted to participate in intense shooting sequences. The goal is usually to kill all the enemies that pop out on the screen before they are able to kill Gillian. Some of such sequences are timed, i.e. the player is required to quickly shoot before another events is triggered, leading to the protagonist's death.</desc>

The game is composed out of large-scaled tactical battles. The player navigates the combatants over the screen and tries to accomplish missions without having the main hero killed. Most of the attacks in the game are ranged, and each weapon has unique properties. It is possible to choose full or spreading attacks with many firearms, throw bombs and use special abilities. Weapons have limited ammunition, and must be equipped manually before using. Powerful area attacks can be executed, but they damage everyone in the area, including player-controlled characters. Robot-like machines can be controlled directly by the player or set on auto mode.</desc>

		<desc>Steam Heart's is a 2D sci-fi vertically scrolling shoot-em-up with erotic content. The game takes place in the far future, on an alien planet dominated by seven elf-like or catgirl princesses that have fallen under the spell of a unique virus that has driven them mad and threatens to destroy the planet if all the rulers declare all-out war.

Only Blondia Varady (nicknamed "Blow") and his sister Fallandia have been spared from the disease and must pilot their fighter ships in order to penetrate deep into the domain of each princess, destroy their war machines, and administer the antidote. Fortunately for Blow, the antidote has been synthesized into his reproductive organ, so that means there is only one way to inoculate the girls....

The player controls the fighter ship through vertically scrolling stages, trying to destroy every ship that crosses its path and reach the end boss. The ship has a primary weapon that can be constantly upgraded by collecting power-ups, and a secondary slot for all sorts of collectible weapons that can be picked up in mid-air. The game features 2P-cooperative gameplay and cutscenes made of still images that explain the plot and depict the protagonist's encounters with each princess.</desc>

Tokimeki Memorial is a dating simulation game. There is a schedule in the game, which includes school-related and free-time activities. The player characters has various statistics that can be raised by performing certain activities (such as studying to increase intelligence, etc.). The gameplay is dedicated almost entirely to planning schedules, getting the maximum out of the date with the chosen girl. A date is not necessarily automatic success - neglecting a girl for a long time will lead to gossip and eventually may destroy the relationship. There is also a "rival" in the game, a male student who might succeed with one of the girls if the player is not careful enough.</desc>

As the manager of one of the young girls who wants to participate in the contest, the player has to do everything in his/her power to attain the goal, and help the disciple reach stardom!

Virgin Dream is what is commonly called life simulation, a genre popularized by games such as the  Princess Maker series. The player manages the life of the young girl with a specific goal in mind, which must be chosen from the main menu. The girl can strive to become a singer, a photo model, a school teacher, etc. The player then tries to alter her statistics accordingly to achieve the goal.

The main activities on work days are divided into three groups: training, working, and learning. The learning category is the smallest one, but is also necessary for continuing the girl's normal school life. Training includes singing, arts, body building, sports, etc. Part-time jobs such as waitress, cook, private tutor, and even construction worker are available; the pay varies greatly, but so are the changes in parameters.

On holidays, the girl is able to venture outside and explore the top-down city, which contains various shops, boutiques, offices, etc. Clothes and other accessories can be purchased. It is also possible to talk and bond with other girls, potential rivals, who live in the same dormitory. All this influences the heroine's parameters, for good and for bad. </desc>

		<desc>Wizardry III?IV contains two role-playing games from the Wizardry series: Legacy of Llylgamyn and The Return of Werdna. Both games were ported to the PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD console with various enhancements, unreleased separately. The player automatically starts playing Legacy of Llylgamyn; playing The Return of Werdna can be accessed via "Utility" option in the town menu. Though the game(s) are rather faithful in gameplay and graphical design to the original computer versions, the enhancements are significant enough to consider this a remake. 

Unlike the computer originals with their vector lines, the dungeons have simple graphics now. Enemy sprites are also drawn in a more detailed fashion. A pre-made party of six is available to the player right at the beginning, consisting of characters with generic names ("Fighter", "Samurai", etc.); creating own characters (unlike in the modified PC Engine CD version of Might and Magic), however, remains possible. Naturally, in The Return of Werdna the player controls Werdna himself and his summoned monsters. Another notable change is the inclusion of orchestrated CD audio music for dungeon navigation and (optionally) for battle music.</desc>

		<name>Wizardry V - Heart Of The Maelstrom</name>
		<desc>After L'Kbreth's Orb was used to bring peace back to the land of Llylgamyn, a new threat emerges in the region. Strange malevolent energies have been spotted beneath the Temple of Sages. These energies - called the "Maelstrom" by the local inhabitants - can be sealed by a person known as the Gatekeeper. Unfortunately, the latter has been imprisoned by a mysterious power or person only referred to as SORN. A party of brave adventurers seeks out the high priest G'bli Gedook, the guardian of L'Kbreth's Orb, who explains to them that they have to release the Gatekeeper and eventually vanquish the evil at its core.

Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom returns to the gameplay concept of the first three installments of the series, abandoning the unusual premise of its predecessor. As in the initial games, the gameplay consists of exploring a vast maze-like dungeon with a custom party created and outfitted in the game's only town. Though visually very similar to their predecessors, the game's dungeon is no longer limited to a square layout. Several tweaks have been applied to the gameplay system, including range rating for all weapons (allowing back row attacks), a more prominent role for the Thief class (who can now hide in shadows, backstab enemies, and open locks), etc.

The game is more puzzle-oriented than the preceding entries, requiring the player to obtain a larger quantity of crucial items needed for its completion. It is the first installment in the series with friendly NPCs who can be encountered in the dungeon and interacted with by typing keywords. Also for the first time, the game allows - but does not require - importing characters from a previous scenario.</desc>

But one day, a messenger brings terrible news: the castle of Farland was attacked, the king, the princess, and countless soldiers brutally slain. Zomu Dizae, the third and the final demon commander of the dark world Zekisis (Latok has defeated the other two, Badu and Gospel), has arrived. He is aided by the treacherous Necromancer, who turned the soldiers of Farland into monsters. Will Latok be able to defeat the evil once again?

Xak III: The Eternal Recurrence is an action RPG, similar in gameplay style to its  predecessors, but also incorporating some elements first introduced in  Tower of Gazel, such as the ability to jump and having companions (although this feature is much more limited here). Jumping ability is crucial in many cases, as there are obstacles that can only be avoided by jumping over them. Latok starts at level 50, but still can gain experience points and become stronger. A new (and very useful) feature is hit points restoration, which occurs when Latok is standing still. To counter that, enemies can re-spawn, which means that there aren't many completely safe areas in the game.</desc>

		<name>Yawara! 2 - A Fashionable Judo Girl!</name>
		<desc>Based on the manga and subsequent anime series Yawara: A Fashionable Judo Girl, this game can be considered a sequel to  Yawara!, since its events take place after the conclusion of the previous story line. This time, the player controls Fujiko Itou, one of the original series' heroines, an admirer of Yawara. After having won a major international competition, Yawara feels she cannot bear the fame, longing to return to normal life and leave judo. Shocked by this decision, Fujiko decides to train herself and become a judo master, in order to convince Yawara to come back.

Unlike the previous game, which was entirely a "digital comic", Yawara 2 has three different gameplay modes. The Japanese-style adventure part plays similarly to the predecessor and to most other games of this style: the player has a few verbs to choose from a menu; choosing all of them one-by-one invariably advances the story. This part is heavy on non-interactive cut scenes.

Another gameplay mode is a quiz featuring questions related to the original series; the player has to choose the correct answer among four available ones, and a wrong answer leads to instant Game Over.

Finally, the so-called "Battle" gameplay mode is a judo fighting game. It plays similarly to other fighting games (even with its own story, versus, and two-player modes), but instead of the usual punches, kicks, jumps, and special moves, the player is only allowed to execute authentic judo moves and play by the rules. Many moves involve rapid pressing of different buttons. The player controls Fujiko, and in the versus mode is able to choose to fight fictional champions from the original story line.

Beside these gameplay modes, the game features an extensive Yawara!-related database, with character profiles, information, and even the titular heroine giving a cooking lesson.</desc>

While she is trying to have an ordinary life, her grandfather insists on her studying the martial art of judo, and she has troubles to decide what her goal in life is going to be. The game's protagonist is one of the minor characters in the manga, a young journalist named Matsuda. Seeing how Yawara effortlessly beats up an assailant on the street, Matsuda decides to find out who the "wonder girl" is, feeling that she is going to become a famous sports star.

The game is what is commonly known as digital comic, i.e. Japanese-style adventure game without puzzles and with very limited, basic interaction possibilities. Typically, the player is presented with a few verb commands and object sub-menus at every screen, and has to go through them in order to make progress. Animated and voiced cutscenes frequently occur in order to advance the narrative.</desc>

Ys III: Wanderers from Ys breaks away from the "bumping into enemies" battle system of the first two games, allowing Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions. Beside changing the battle system, the game's perspective switches to a side-scrolling view, as opposed to the top-down one of the previous games. Adol also has the ability to jump now.  New to the series is the use of magical rings, which give Adol different powering-up abilities such as healing and shielding. The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.</desc>

		<desc>Ankoku Bujutsukai is based on the manga Y? Y? Hakusho, which tells the story of a young delinquent named Yusuke Urameshi who dies and becomes reincarnated as a reward for a good deed he committed, further serving as an "underworld detective" and solving demon-related mysteries. This adaptation of the manga follows the "Dark Tournament" story arc, where members of Yusuke's team confront the powerful demon Toguro.

Despite its premise, which is reminiscent of a versus fighting game, Ankoku Bujutsukai is an arcade-style shooter. The player selects one of the five characters (Yusuke, Hiei, Kurama, Kuwabara or Genkai), and is then taken to a series of one-on-one shoot-outs in a pre-determined order. The enemy is viewed from a first-person perspective, and the player moves a cursor to aim and shoot. The gameplay system is fairly simple, allowing the player to execute three types of attacks: regular shots, charged shots, and special attacks of limited quantity. Points are received for winning fights and can be used to raise the characters' hit points, speed, or number of special moves.</desc>

		<desc>The Dark Ones have captured the Ring of Five and imprisoned the wizards that guard it. A barbarian named Lykos has the power to transform into different creatures. He needs to rescue the wizards and the Ring of Five from the Dark Ones before they invade his home, Krellion.

Shape Shifter is a side-scrolling action game with platforming and light role-playing elements. Much of the game consists of traversing hostile areas, fighting regular enemies on the way and defeating bosses. The game's "hub" area is a town where Lykos can replenish his health and buy any of the three available weapons (axe, mace, or bow). These weapons can be upgraded by enchanting them or picking up power-ups.

After Lykos rescues a wizard he gains access to a transformation power. Transformations require special gems and cannot be performed if Lykos runs out of them. There are four transformations in the game: the panther can jump over large gaps; the shark can swim; the golem can jump higher; and the golden dragon can fly. Each of these forms can also collect power-ups that unlocks a few other attack abilities.

The game's stages are interconnected, but usually a new form must be acquired before Lykos can access a new area. Lykos has eight lives consisting of smaller health units (hearts). The game can only be saved in the town.</desc>

		<desc>Kabuki Itt?ry?dan is set in the  Tengai Maky? universe, and is a spin-off of  F?un Kabuki Den. There is no actual story in the game; various characters from F?un Kabuki Den, headed by the charismatic actor/world-savior Kabuki Danjuro himself, fight each other for no apparent reason - even the "scenario mode" allows the player to choose any of the eight available characters, putting him/her against friends and foes alike, one by one.

The characters are a mixture of protagonists, villains, and support characters from F?un Kabuki Den's, including the heroes Kabuki, Okuni, and Zeami, as well as the villains Kikugorou and Garp, and - naturally! - the recurrent stupid ape Mantou. 

Beside the scenario mode, there is also a Vs. mode, which is basically a two-player mode, allowing two players to fight against each other as any of the eight characters; and a so-called "Life Attack" mode, which randomly chooses AI-controlled opponents for a player-selected character.

Kabuki Itt?ry?dan plays like a typical fighting game, the two basic moves being a kick and a punch; other moves are unique for each character and involve strong melee moves or magic-like ranged attacks. For example, Kabuki is able to attack with a sword, while Okuni can set her opponents on fire.</desc>

		<desc>The TV Show is a humorous overhead action game similar to Bomberman in concept. The game consists of a scenario mode (single-player) and a versus mode (up to four players). Both modes offer seven characters to choose from. The characters are comically-themed and include a hyperactive schoolgirl, an armored ninja, and others. There is no real storyline behind these characters; each comes with a short introduction sequence that invariably leads to their admittance to an alien-organized TV show, where they have to defeat enemies and retrieve prizes.

Each stage is an overhead screen containing the protagonist, enemies, the prize, and several bombs. The bombs should be picked up and carried around; they are used to deal with enemies and blow up the receptacle in which the prize is contained. The green bombs change their color to yellow and red when picked up, at which point they are about to explode and have to be thrown to avoid damage. Bombs also blow holes in the terrain, and the player must pay attention not to fall through. In addition to bomb-carrying and bomb-throwing, each character possesses a special ability. These range from throwing projectiles at enemies to speeding up when driving a bike, depending on the selected character.</desc>

In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.

Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used. </desc>

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</desc>
