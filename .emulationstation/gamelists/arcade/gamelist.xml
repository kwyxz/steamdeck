		<name>10-Yard Fight</name>
		<desc>The game is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling. The player does not select plays for either offense or defense. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to a running back, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted.
10-Yard Fight has five levels of difficulty; from easiest to most difficult: high school, college, professional, playoff, and Super Bowl. If the player wins both halves of an "accelerated real time" 30-minute half at an easier level, the player advanced to the next level of difficulty, like a career mode.</desc>

		<name>1943: The Battle of Midway</name>
		<desc>The game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese Air Fleet that bombed the players' American Aircraft Carrier, pursue all Japanese Air and Sea forces, fly through the 16 levels of play, make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 Levels consist of an Air-to-Sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as an End-Level Boss), while 5 levels consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese Bombers and a Mother Bomber that needs to be destroyed.
As in 1942, players pilot a P-38. Two buttons are used: one for regular attacks (with several weapons) and one for special actions that executes either a loop like in 1942 or one of three special attacks that damage the plane. Unlike 1942, the player only has one life, with one refillable energy meter. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a temporary special weapons which replaces the default twin gun.</desc>

The objective of every level is to shoot enemy planes, tanks, trains, turrets, battleships, and defeat the boss after each level. Unlike its predecessor, 19XX: The War Against Destiny, the game plays more like the early games in the series.</desc>

		<name>2020 Super Baseball</name>
		<desc>In the year 2020, baseball finally evolved. There is no longer conventional professional baseball in 2020. Baseball designed by the Super Baseball Association has been very popular and is the best sport.

However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium.

In 2020 Super Baseball is a fast-paced game with new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual men, women, or robot players. During play, you can make your team stronger with prizes earned from amazing catches.

All of the vehicles are, of course, fully armed to deal with the many enemy vehicles and gun emplacements intent on stopping the player's progress. The helicopter levels play as a straightforward vertically-scrolling shoot'em up and bear more than a passing resemblance to Namco's "Xevious".</desc>

		<desc>After Burner is another Sega game rendered with their then-ubiquitous 3-D sprite-scaling technology; this time putting the player into the seat of a powerful F14 Tomcat jet fighter. 

Players must fight their way through 21 colourful, fast-moving stages, shooting down waves of enemy fighters while avoiding the enemy's incoming missiles. The F14 is equipped with a machine gun and a limited number of homing missiles. The gun has infinite ammunition and targeting is achieved by maneuvering the Tomcat so that the targeting cursor situated just in front of the jet is placed over an enemy fighter. 

After Burner's straightforward shoot-em-up gameplay is simple and repetitive, but the game's incredible visuals ensured its success.</desc>

The two sides each control a launcher vehicle that can shoot missiles. The player needs to reconstruct the shape as shown in the top window. This is done by solving a sliding puzzle.
If a shape is formed on top of a missile block, the missile is launched and and either collides with a missile of the opponent or with the launcher vehicle itself. The player needs to strategize to move the shape in a certain direction to cover as many missiles as possible.</desc>

		<name>Air Duel</name>
		<desc>The player selects from a jet fighter or helicopter, shoot enemies in the air and ground, collect power-ups, and defeat bosses to advance levels.

The game differs from most others in the genre in that you can change the aircraft you use at the start of each level. The jet fighter always shoots straight forward; power-ups increase the width and strength of its shots. The helicopter fires thinner and weaker shots, but turns in the direction it moves (similar to the later Zero Gunner), giving it great range; powerups increase the strength of shots, as well as the number of bullets per shot (adding a small "spread" effect to the shot while moving around).
Both the fighter and the helicopter also start with three bombs which wipe out everything in their path, including enemy shots. These bombs are also unique compared to similar games, in that they produce a line of small horizontal blasts that can be "directed" at the line travels across the ground, by pressing left and right (similar to the helicopter's shots). Additional bombs can be picked up during the course of the game.

Losing a life resets your power and bomb count to the amount you start with. "Air Duel" is a challenging game, and later levels can become nearly unplayable if a single life is lost.</desc>

The player must collect four power ups to upgrade their weapon. There are four weapon types: L, a laser weapon, S, a support drone, M, a tracing missile, and F, gatling Fire, a spread-out vulcan bullet shot.

Four levels of power-ups are available for each weapon, however each level requires four power up tokens be collected. There are also two special "bomb" weapons available for collection - green Energy Spark for a screen-covering swarm of lower-power bombs and blue Thunder Drive for a narrower and more focused attack. The Energy Spark clears all bullets from the screen, while the Thunder Drive only clears bullets that actually touch the blast. This blast starts momentarily atop the player, but quickly moves forward a short distance and stays stationary for a few seconds before dissipating.</desc>

He will now have to hit each of the forty thieves as they enter the room - but if one of them should make it to the room at the bottom of the screen he will pick up one of the seven bags of money then try to take it back up to the room at the top of the screen. If the thieves take all seven of the money bags up to the top of the screen, it will cost Ali Baba a life; but, if he "hits" all forty thieves without this happening (except the large and invulnerable red one), he will proceed to the next level.</desc>

		<desc>Alien Syndrome is a overhead-view run and gun game for one or two players in which a number of Mankind's space ships and bases have been overrun by an alien race, who have taken the human inhabitants hostage.

Players control two soldiers named Ricky and Mary and must fight their way through large eight-way scrolling levels to rescue their captured comrades. Once a set number of hostages have been rescued, an exit opens and players can pass through it to fight the end-of-level guardian. Once the guardian is defeated, play moves onto the next stage.

A time-bomb is automatically set at the start of each stage, which must then be completed before the bomb's timer runs down. Failure to finish the level in time results in the death of the player characters. Weapon upgrades and maps of the current level are available at certain points and are accessed via hatchways in the wall.

Alien Syndrome consists of 6 full stages plus a 7th final mini-stage, consisting solely of a fight to the death against the game's final, massive guardian.</desc>

Before they can be killed, a pair of the Predators appear and destroy the Aliens. The Predators offer an alliance with the two humans in order to stop the Alien infestation.

The players take control of up to three of four characters: Dutch, Linn, a Predator hunter, and a Predator warrior, and battle the Aliens through several environments. In the process, the characters discover that the Alien presence on Earth is the result of an experiment headed by a renegade General Bush of the U.S. Colonial Marines in conjunction with the Weyland-Yutani corporation. They destroy the Alien hive by crashing a military ship into San Drad, causing a huge explosion. The Predator warrior then gives his wrist blades to Dutch and Linn in recognition of their skills as warriors, before the Predators depart back into space.</desc>

		<name>Aliens</name>
		<desc>Aliens is a scrolling run 'n' gun game for one or two players based on the classic 1986 science-fiction movie of the same name. Players take on the role of either Ellen Ripley (in the single-player game) or Corporal Hicks (in the two-player game) and must shoot their way through the alien-infested levels of the LV426 base to make their escape together with 'Newt', the little girl who survived the alien invasion of her settlement.

Players begin the game armed only with a pulse rifle but will have opportunities to upgrade to other weapons, including flamethrowers and grenade launchers. Bombs can also be found that cause greater damage to the enemies. Each player life starts with eight health points which deplete upon contact with either an alien or an enemy projectile and once all health points are lost, the player loses a life. Each stage ends with a Boss encounter, with the game's final boss being the Alien Queen herself. 

As well as the standard side-scrolling stages, intermittent into-the-screen stages also feature that have the players riding atop the Marines' APC vehicle, shooting the hordes of aliens that swarm towards it.

As well as the standard Aliens and Face-huggers from the original film (that now come in a variety of different colours), there are many enemies that were created only for the arcade game and have never appeared elsewhere in the Alien franchise. These include flying aliens and mutated humans, as well as all end-of-stage bosses prior to the Alien queen.</desc>

		<name>Major Havoc</name>
		<desc>Major Havoc is a vector-based shoot-em-up and platform game in which the evil Vaxxian Empire overran the galaxy many years ago. Most of humanity was enslaved and abducted to the Vaxxian home world, although a few human scientists managed to escape. The Vaxxian Empire has long since collapsed but numerous Vaxxian space stations, all blindly controlled and defended by robots, still remain in the galaxy, mindlessly following their original, pre-programmed orders.

The small band of scientists who initially escaped have cloned the great human hero, 'Major Havoc' and tasked him with flying his 'Catastrofighter' through a wormhole in space so that he may lead a clone army against the dreaded Vaxxian robots and to liberate the remnants of humanity by destroying the enemy reactors. The player controls Major Rex Havoc, the leader of this band of clones.

The game is broken down into two distinct gameplay genres. The first is a shoot-'em-up in which the player controls Major Havoc's spaceship against the numerous robot ships that defend the enemy reactors. The ships are encased in a force-field shield which must first be shot and depleted before the ship itself can be destroyed. </desc>

		<name>Amidar</name>
		<desc>Amidar is an abstract arcade game in which players must 'colour in' all of the rectangles on the screen. Each level has a number of patrolling enemies called 'Amidars' that must be avoided but players are aided in their task with the inclusion of a JUMP button which, when used, causes all the on-screen enemies to jump, giving the player time to escape. There are only three 'jumps' given per level, however.

On odd-numbered levels, the player's character is a gorilla who eats coconuts; on even-numbered levels, it's a paint roller. The game's enemy Amidars are savages and pigs respectively. Whenever a rectangular portion of the board is cleared (either by collecting all surrounding coconuts, or painting all surrounding edges), the rectangle is coloured in and on the even levels, bonus points are awarded, while on the odd-numbered levels, points are awarded for each coconut eaten. 

If players manage to fill in all four corner rectangles of a board, they are briefly able to kill the enemies by touching them (similar to the 'Power-pill' from Namco's Pac-Man series). Enemies killed in this way fall to the bottom of the screen and recover after a few seconds.

On the even-numbered paint roller levels, the roller cannot move too far from grid rectangles that have already been filled without running out of paint and having to return to completed parts of the map to refresh its supply. When this happens, any painted lines that are not part of a filled rectangle will vanish and must be painted again. This means that the player must build their completed squares around the starting point of the level and spread outwards, rather than completing squares on any part of the board as they can on the odd-numbered Gorilla levels. This makes filling in the corner rectangles to become invincible much more difficult.

In between levels players are given the possibility of earning 5,000 bonus points. Here, an Amidar moves across the top of the screen, by pushing the jump button the Amidar traces a random path down towards the bottom of the screen. If the Amidar reaches a bunch of bananas, a bonus is awarded.</desc>

Fight your way through seven stages in this horizontal-scrolling game, and defeat a boss at the end of each one. You start the game with four main weapons, which you can switch from with the click of a button. Some of these weapons are more powerful than others. You can also fire off a charged shot if your main weapon level is two or greater, simply by holding down the fire button for about two seconds. Using charged shots can do more damage to an enemy ship. If you happen to die, you will lose one power level from all four weapons. If all your lives are lost and are forced to continue, you will start again with your main weapon on the second power level and all three sub-weapons on the first power level.</desc>

The object of the game is to eat all of the larvae - represented as round dots - before the timer runs out. Once all larvae have been eaten, play moves onto the next stage.

Players can only eat ants with the tip of the anteater's tongue, if an ant touches any other part of the tongue, the anteater is bitten and a player life is lost. As well as the ants, worms also roam the stages, worms will not harm the anteater upon contact with the extended tongue but if the head of the worm touches the tongue's tip, the player loses a life. Worms can be safely eaten from behind. 

Large queen ants are situated at the bottom of the nest and eating these will temporarily clear all insects from the screen.  

Anteater has a short day-night cycle represented by a moving Sun at the top of the screen. Once the sun has traveled across the screen and night falls, a spider will appear. The spider climbs down the anteater's tongue, taking a life if it reaches the tongue's tip. The spider can only be killed by eating a queen ant.</desc>

A long time ago, an evil wizard has taken over the peaceful kingdom of Shahariyard and used sorcery to transform its king into a Monkey. The player must defeat each of the game's seven Guardians to reclaim the 'Jewel of Seven Colours' and release the king from the evil hex. 

Each player can select from four distinctive characters: Prince Lassid, Princess Lisa, Sinbad or Afshael. Each character carries a primary weapon - Prince Lassid and Sinbad carry swords, Princess Lisa a magical veil and Afshael a mace. In addition to the weapons, players can also summon a magical attack in the form of a huge genie. The genie will only appear for a few seconds but during that time, players have control over the genie and can steer him towards enemies. 

Arabian Magic has seven different stages with one of the powerful guardians awaiting the player at the end of each level. Each guardian, once defeated, will drop a jewel which forms a part of the Jewel of Seven Colours. Guardians, once defeated, will join the player and become a Genie. Each level is littered with vases and wooden chests which, when broken, reveal treasure items and power-ups. 

The game ends when the player has recovered the Jewel of Seven Colours, saved the King (making him human in the process) and restored peace to Shahariyard.</desc>

		<desc>After a sudden alien assault, the Arkanoid spaceship has been destroyed and the only survivor, the small 'Vaus' space vessel, has been mysteriously trapped in another dimension by an unknown enemy. The player is charged with helping the 'Vaus' overcome the security systems, as well as the many enemies that guard them, before finally finding and destroying 'DOH', the alien responsible for the attack.

Arkanoid is an update of the early ball and paddle video games - and specifically of Atari's 1978 classic, "Super Breakout" - in which the player takes control of a paddle at the bottom of the screen and must use it to deflect a ball into rows of bricks at the top of the screen, thus destroying them and, eventually, clearing the screen to progress to the next level. 

As well as impressive and colourful graphics, Arkanoid introduced a number of new elements to the classic bat 'n' ball gameplay. Certain bricks, when destroyed, would release a power-up - in the form of a falling capsule. the player had to catch the capsule to retrieve the power-up. Among the many enhancements the power-ups provided were an increased 'bat' size, multiple balls, 'sticky' ball (which would stick to the bat and could be released when the player chose) and even a laser, which allowed the player to shoot the bricks.</desc>

The mysterious enemy known as 'DOH' has returned to seek vengeance on the 'Vaus' space vessel. The player must once again take control of the Vaus and overcome many challenges in order to destroy DOH once and for all. 

An update of the popular 1986 original, Revenge of DOH sees the player battle through 34 rounds, taken from a grand total of 64. Revenge of DOH differs from its predecessor with the introduction of "Warp Gates". Upon completion of a round or when the Break ('B') pill is caught, two gates appear at the bottom left and bottom right of the play area respectively, the Vaus is then taken through one of the gates - the choice will affect which version of the next round is provided.

The game also features two new features for bricks. Notched silver bricks, like normal silver bricks, take several hits to destroy. However, after a short period of time after destruction, they regenerate at full strength. Fortunately, clearing a level does not require that any notched bricks to be destroyed. Also, some bricks move from side to side as long as their left and/or right sides are not obstructed by other bricks.

The game features a mini-boss in the form of a giant brain, which will help you practice for DOH. You must aim for the brain's mouth to defeat it.</desc>

Each level is patrolled by enemies and certain bricks, when hit, release power-ups which then roll down the screen and can be collected by the player.

While the 3rd chapter contains 50 brand new levels for players to fight through, the actual gameplay itself remains unaltered from the first 2 games. The only real differences are a revamp of both the graphics and sound, as well as a number of minor enhancements to the in-game power-ups.</desc>

But this peace was not to last. A year after a truce was signed between the two forces, former Raian army captain Azrael, who has converted himself into a cyborg in an attempt to become "the perfect warrior", has marshalled several thousand other cyborgs and declared war against the Raian Kingdom. Robbing mobile weapons from the army, this group of rogues has invaded the Raian capital of Merkid and has begun to abduct the civilians.

The United World Government, receiving an emergency message from the planet Raia, has but one choice: to organize and dispatch an army formed around its elite corps, a squadron of warriors called "Bloody Armor", to eradicate the enemy forces and rescue the civilians.

And so, in October 2282, the United World Forces begin to launch its attack upon the planet Raia.

The most intense battle in human history is about to begin...</desc>

		<desc>Your mission is to reclaim your homeland by destroying the enemy forces that have taken over. You have an Assault tank, the supreme mobile weapon. Your tank has artillery guns and grenades, can perform Rapid Rolls to dodge enemy shots, and uses Power Wheelies to launch grenades.

Your controls are two 4-position joysticks with triggers. These controls make Assault like no other tank game. You have a quick, highly responsive vehicle with fast movement in all directions. To avoid enemy shots, Rapid Roll your tank left or right by moving both joysticks to the same side. To launch grenades, put the tank in the Power Wheelie position by moving both joysticks to the outside, then pressing either trigger. Your grenades are triple the fire power of your tank's standard shots.

Your tank is always in the center of the screen no matter what direction you are going. With Assault's 360-degree scrolling playfield, the world rotates around you as you move. An arrow always points you towards the exit to the next level.

The lift zone gives you an advantage over the invaders and a spectacular view of the playfield. Each lift zone is a five-sided platform on the playfield that flashes red when you can use it. When you drive onto the lift zone, your tank jets straight up to get a bird's eye view of the surrounding terrain and enemy lines. From this overhead position, you can reconnoiter enemy forces and bomb enemy outposts.

Fight your way through 11 different levels to seek out and destroy the invaderâ€™s headquarters. To succeed, you must:
Dodge enemy gunfire with the Rapid Roll maneuver.
Assault enemy lines with long-range powerful grenades launched from Power Wheelies.
Destroy all enemy tanks you encounter to prevent rear attacks.
Bomb enemy outposts and reconnoiter enemy emplacements using the lift zones.
Protect yourself against enemy artillery using buildings and trees.
Blow up the large cannons on each level while you avoid enemy attacks.
Follow the arrow to find the exit to the next level. Before you can exit, you must destroy the large cannons defending the enemy strongholds.</desc>

Asterix and Obelix each have standard jump/attack controls, as well as a dash attack activated by tapping the joystick forward twice then pressing the attack button. Each character also posesses a powerful spinning arm attack, this is activated by holding the attack button for a short while until the character's face turns red, after which players must release the button. If the button is held down for too long, the character gets out of breath and takes a few seconds to recover.

The heroes' main foes are Roman legionaries and fat - ocassionally horseback riding - centurions. After an enemy has been beaten enough to fall to the ground, he can be picked up and attacked again, the nature of the attack is dependant on which character picks them up; Asterix will spin the stunned enemy above his head, whereas Obelix smashes him repeatedly into the ground. These stunned enemies also act as tempoarary weapons, as they will cause damage to any other enemies they come into contact with.

You start out with nothing more than your feet to fight with and no more protection than Athena's underwear (she actually loses her dress in the intro to the first world) but can collect a huge number of different weapons and armour, as well as a great number of power-ups ranging from the usual more-power-for weapon or armour, through boots that allow her to jump higher and wings for flying, to one where Athena becomes a semi-god and actually growths to twice her usual size and gets a huge burning sword and full armour.

The worlds are filled with stone blocks that can be smashed when searching for secrets and items, as well as several levels connected by ladders or other means of transportation.

Athena is a great game, and will give even the most hardened platform-player a real challenge, for it is NOT an easy game, even with the dip switches in 'Easy' mode.</desc>

		<desc>This follow up to Baseball Stars Professional features a fast-paced arcade style baseball with six fictitious teams, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  There are two difficulties of play: Beginner, which automatically fields the ball for the player while Exciting has the player do the field manually.  Additionally, there are two main modes of play where in the single player mode the player will compete in a fifteen-team tournament or go head-to-head against a friend in a multiplayer mode.

The standard rules of baseball still apply, but it adds power-ups that the player can pick up and use during the game, such as the ability for their pitcher to throw faster or their batter to hit better.  They can also substitute a player during the game, but are limited to three substitutions per game. The game is shown through 2D graphics with comic-style cutscenes to illustrate the action, such as dramatic catches and home runs that will pop-up during the game.</desc>

		<path>./batsugun.zip</path>
		<name>Batsugun</name>
		<desc>A vertically scrolling shoot'em up game. As is the standard with most arcade shooters, the player controls their ship with a joystick and two buttons. One button (Fire) shoots the main guns, and the other button (Bomb) releases a smart bomb that spreads huge energy balls all around the player's ship.

As enemies are destroyed, the player gains experience points that are separate from the score. For every 288 experience points gained, the main gun will 'level up', becoming much stronger. This is analogous to experience points and leveling up in role playing games. The weapon can only level up twice, so after it has achieved its maximum level, 288 experience points will grant the player an extra bomb.

The player can also grab P icons to increase the power of the current level gun. A maximum of five "P"s can be collected per experience level; getting more after this gives extra points instead.

Collecting B icons increases the number of bombs, to a maximum of 7.

Apart from destroying enemies, points can be gained from collecting golden V-shaped medals. After the level is finished, 3000 points are awarded for every small one, and 5000 points for every large one. If the player's ship is destroyed during a level, all medals collected are lost.</desc>

		<name>Battle Garegga</name>
		<desc>Widely considered as both the origin of the bullet hell sub-genre and one of its standouts, Battle Garegga's true joy lies in unravelling the game's various complex systems.

Battle Garegga is both loved and hated in hardcore communities as being highly punishing to the player. This is due to Garegga's usage of the concept of "rank" - the idea being that the game adapts its own difficulty to suit the level of the player, an idea commonly used to a minor degree in most shooters. The difference here is that the rank system is very unforgiving - Powering up the ship, collecting surplus powerups and collecting options all increase the rank, often drastically if the game is played like a typical shooter.

If the player does not carefully manage the constant invisible increase of rank, the last two levels may become physically impossible to complete - rank increasing bullet density and speed, as well as the behavior of enemies. The only way to decrease rank is to get shot down, meaning expert players will learn to commit suicide in key areas to manage their rank.</desc>

At the start of the game in 1P mode, the player will face against the other fighter that uses the same fighting style as the one the player chose. After the player wins against the opponent, the player will face against other opponents that use other fighting styles in the K-Road Tournament. If the player loses, the game will only allow the player to continue fighting through it with the character he used, and will not allow the player to choose another character.

The gameplay has a 6-button layout, but with command inputs different compared to ones in most fighting games released at the time. There are three punches and kicks for a few directions (weak, medium and strong). There are seven fighting styles featured in the game and two playable characters per style, for a total of 14 playable fighters.</desc>

To aid him in his mission, Joe is equipped with a bionic arm; a telescopic grappling hook that is used to traverse the many platforms and ledges that make up the game's levels. The arm can also be used to temporarily stun enemies or knock them from platforms, as well as to retrieve the bonus items, wooden crates and weapons that are occasionally dropped into the war zone by parachute. 

As well as the bionic arm, Joe is armed with a shotgun used to kill enemies and destroy obstructions. The shotgun can only be fired left and right, however, and cannot be used at the same time as the bionic arm. More powerful guns can be picked up throughout the game. </desc>

		<name>Black Tiger</name>
		<desc>Black Dragon/Tiger is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up set in a fantasy world and is the spiritual successor to the Capcom classic, "Makaimura" ("Ghosts'n' Goblins" outside Japan).

The player takes on the role of a barbarian hero who must jump and fight his way through a variety of colourful, enemy-packed levels, collecting treasure and weapon power-ups and rescuing the trapped 'wise old men' that litter the levels. 

Rescuing the wise men sees the player awarded 'Zeny coins'; these are the game's currency and allow the player to buy such items as weapon and armour upgrades, keys for treasure chests, anti-poisoning potions and health potions from the shops that appear on each level. Occasionally, a rescued wise man will also offer to sell the player weapon and armour power-ups. 

The barbarian hero is armed with a spiked mace on the end of a long chain, as well as unlimited throwing daggers. Both these and the armour worn by the barbarian (which offers limited protection from enemy attacks) can be upgraded by finding or buying the relevant power-ups.

The sprawling, eight-way scrolling levels are packed with hidden bonuses to encourage and reward exploration. These bonuses are in the form of weapon and armour power-ups, as well as valuable treasure items. Many levels also include a hidden dungeon and each dungeon is filled with both bonus items and trapped wise men.

Special items that reveal coins, upgraded armour, or simply bonus points can be found by attacking certain walls.</desc>

		<name>Blast Off</name>
		<desc>Blast Off is a vertically scrolling shoot'em up. Despite the drastically different gameplay, Blast Off is the sequel to Bosconian which was released eight years earlier.

As in many other vertical scrolling shooters (including Namco's own Xevious), the player controls a ship, facing the top of the screen, that can move freely while the background scrolls down, bringing enemies in to view; the player may destroy enemies for points. The game uses two buttons - one is used to make the ship fire circular lasers, while the other is used to cycle through its four firing patterns. The red pattern is two lasers in a spiral pattern, while the blue one is one laser straight ahead and one behind, the yellow one is one laser straight ahead, one left, and one right and the green one is two lasers diagonally forward (one to the left and one to the right), and one straight behind; by holding down the button, the ship fires more powerful, spherical lasers.</desc>

		<desc>The player takes control of a spaceship and must fight against wave after wave of enemy fighters, while trying to rescue the stranded astronauts that represent the last surviving remnants of the human race. Enemies attack the player both with weapons, and by making 'suicide runs' at the player's ship. The game consists of eleven different levels, nine of which are repeated, bringing the total number of levels to 20. 

The levels are: Planetoid Waves, Robot Grid Waves, Saucerland Waves, Vampire Waves, Time Tunnel Waves, Outer Space Waves, Enduro Waves, Cat World Waves, and Mastermind Waves (there are two of each of these). 

There are also two unique waves that occur only once, they are Armageddon and Paradise. 

Players can select their starting wave at the start of the game; choosing from Planetoids, Robot Grid, Saucerland, and Vampires. During the game, players must be careful to NOT shoot the human astronauts that drift through the levels. These must be rescued by 'running' into them. 

Despite the presence of an energy meter, the player can take exactly three hits before he or she dies. Upon death, the window of the player's virtual cockpit breaks and one of the player's lives is lost. Blaster has a 'Continue' option but this can only be used once.</desc>

Some enemy units can be captured and used in play; certain enemy robots, when shot by the player's Tranquilander, will morph into an outline of themselves. The player can then fly into the outline, and take on the form of the enemy robot, taking control of its weapons, abilities and special attacks.

There is also addition to the boss battle scoring: similar to some shooters, players have the opportunity to increase their scores by beating the end level bosses within a certain time limit. Every time a boss battle is initiated, a timer will count down and once the boss is destroyed/killed before the timer reaches zero, then the time left will add to the player's end-level score; if the timer runs out, then the score at the end of the level will remain unaffected.</desc>

		<name>Block Out</name>
		<desc>Block Out is a 1-player or a simultaneous 2 players competitive game of unique dimensional action and strategy.
As the blocks drop one-by-one into the three-dimensional pit, rotate them by using the three buttons and joystick. Once the player has decided on the the rotation of the block, use the button to drop the block into place. The objective is to place the blocks into the pit without leaving any empty spaces. Once this is achieved, the layers without empty spaces, will disappear.

The player begins the game by selecting a starting stage. Game start level select can be chosen from stages 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20. There is a total of 100 stages in the game and as the players progress through the game, the stages get more and more difficult.
Each stage has a certain number of layers (faces) that must be erased. Once these faces are erased, the player will move on to the next stage. The less blocks the players has left in the pit at the end of the stage, the more points are awarded.

In addition to the one player mode, Block Out offers a competitive simultaneous two player mode. The split screen effect gives each player their own pit with which to play in. They compete against each other in the race to erase the faces. As one player erases a face, that face will be added to the opponent's pit, making their pit rise. This allows less room to work. There are two ways to win in the 2-player mode:
1) Force the opponent to the top of their pit and out of the game
or
2) Erase 21 faces first.</desc>

		<name>Bomb Jack</name>
		<desc>Bomb Jack is a fast-moving platform game in which the aim is to collect all of the bombs on each level before progressing to the next. A variety of constantly spawning mechanical enemies patrol the platforms and airspace so the longer a player takes to collect all of the bombs, the more difficult progress becomes. 

Extra point bonuses are awarded for collecting bombs with their fuses lit. Only one bomb at any time has a lit fuse, and collecting twenty or more of these lit bombs on any given level will earn the player points bonus (see TIPS AND TRICKS for details). Jack is pursued around each level by the spawning enemies and when he gets killed, he drops down to the nearest platform, always landing on his head. 

A 'Powerball' appears at semi-regular intervals and moves diagonally around the screen. If the player manages to grab this, all of the level's monsters are frozen for several seconds and can then be killed by having Jack fly into them (similar to the 'Powerpill' feature in "Pac-Man"). Collecting the Bonus 'B' symbols will increase the amount of points awarded for collecting bombs with their fuses lit. Picking up an 'Extra' symbol awards the player with an additional life, while catching the 'Special' symbol will give the player an extra credit. 

Each of Bomb Jack's levels feature one of five different background pictures, some of which represent famous historical landmarks. They are: the Sphinx in Egypt, the Acropolis in Greece, Castle Neuschwanstein in Bavaria, skyscrapers and a cityscape by night. While the backgrounds themselves are repeated as the game progresses, the platform layouts for each level are completely different. At least until level 18, after which the levels are repeated. 

The basic play mechanic of collecting objects to clear a level, as well as the powerball feature, is hugely reminiscent of Namco's seminal "Pac-Man".</desc>

		<name>Boogie Wings</name>
		<desc>A superbly playable, humourous and utterly unique shoot-em-up from the Date East stable. The player begins each life in control of a bi-plane with a huge metal hook attached to its rear. This hook can be used to pick up enemies, objects, bombs and vehicles which can then be thrown both at other enemies, and at any walls and doorways that may be barring the player's route.

If the bi-plane takes two hits from enemy forces, it will explode and the player is forced to continue on foot. The on-foot sections play in a vaguely similar fashion to SNK's legendary "Metal Slug" series, but while on foot, the player has no protection from enemy hits and is very vulnerable to attack. As such, a replacement vehicle (which appear in the form of tanks, motorbikes, giant robots, elephants etc.) must be found quickly.

Boogie Wings features highly detailed and completely destructible scenery, with a multitude of background animations making the game feel 'alive' and giving it much of its distinctive character. The game's settings are as original as its gameplay; with museums, fairgrounds, the inside of skyscrapers etc. all making an appearance. Boogie Wings soundtrack is also unique to the genre, with a mixture of well-known jazz and blues tunes accompanying the frenetic on-screen action.</desc>

The bubbles can also be used as temporary platforms, to help the dinosaurs reach previously inaccessible areas of a level. 

Any trapped enemies who are not killed quickly enough will turn red and escape their bubble prison. These angry enemies are much faster than before, making them harder to kill. Enemies also become angry if players are taking too long to complete a level. Defeated enemies are turned into bonus fruit items that can be collected for points. </desc>

		<name>Burger Time</name>
		<desc>A platform game in which one or two players take on the role of burger chef 'Peter Pepper'. The chef must create a set number of burgers per level by collecting the separate ingredients needed to make each one (two pieces of bun, the burger itself and/or a garnish, such as lettuce or cheese). 

Each screen is made up of platforms joined by connecting ladders. At the bottom of the screen are a number of empty plates while the burger ingredients lay across the platforms directly above the plates. The chef must walk across the entire width of the ingredients to make them drop to the platform below. A burger is only completed once all of its ingredients have been dropped onto the corresponding plate at the bottom of the screen. 

The chef's efforts are hampered by the rogue ingredients that are constantly chasing him. They are called 'Mr. Hot Dog', 'Mr. Egg' and 'Mr. Pickle'. Any contact with them results in the loss of a life. The chef can temporarily freeze the enemies by throwing pepper at them. He only carries a limited amount of pepper but this can be replenished by collecting the bonus food items that randomly appear (ice cream cones, coffee, and fries). In addition to the pepper, any enemies located on a platform below the chef can be killed by dropping an available burger ingredient on top of them. .</desc>

To stop the fight, Metro police detectives dispatched two dangerous characters, Duke and Billy, to Japan. With the support of the famous Japanese detective Ryu, they decided to rush into the enemy's fortress. Ruthless violence in the neon lights of Osaka. Will there be an end to this war?

Burning Fight is a side-scrolling street-fighting game similar to Final Fight. As Duke, Billy, or Ryu, you must fight your way through the various locations in Osaka. At the start of the game, you can only use your fists to deal with gangs, but by by breaking things like phone booths and street signs along the way, you can get new weapons and more health. At the end of each location, you will have to defeat a boss in order to continue the mission.</desc>

		<name>Cabal</name>
		<desc>Cabal is a war themed shoot-em-up with one or simultaneous two-player gameplay in which two unnamed commandos must battle through five different stages - each containing four screens of play - to reach and defeat an evil dictator.

The game is an into-the-screen shooter with the action viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective. The commandos can move left and right to avoid incoming fire while the enemies themselves are targeted by moving an on-screen cross-hair over them and pressing fire. If the fire button is held down, the commando remains static, allowing for more accurate targeting of the cross-hair. While static, the commandos are vulnerable to incoming enemy fire.

Initially, the commandos are armed with only a standard single-shot gun (albeit with unlimited-ammunition) and a limited number of grenades, but additional grenades and weapon power-ups can be earned as play progresses.

As well as enemy troops, vehicles such as tanks, armoured cars and helicopters also appear and take numerous shots to destroy. When destroyed or killed, some on-screen targets release points bonuses and weapon power-ups that drop to the bottom of the screen and can be picked up by the commandos. Weapon power-ups include additional grenades, a rapid-fire machine and an automatic shotgun, which has a slightly lower firing rate but has a larger targeting cross-hair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot.

Each of the game's screens is littered with buildings and barricades that can also be destroyed. This removes enemy cover as well as earning players bonus points.</desc>

The pilots must escape the prison compound by battling enemy soldiers and vehicles, including tanks planes and helicopters.

The game is very similar in play to SNK's Ikari and Heavy Barrel games, with players able to fully rotate their on-screen characters to fire and move in all directions. Players are initially armed with a machine gun and limited number of grenades but power-ups - including a rocket launcher, a flamethrower and grenades - can be found in the destructible wooden crates that litter the stages. 

Enemy vehicles such as a plane can also be commandeered and the stages take place both above ground in the Vietnamese jungles and below ground in hidden tunnels. Caliber Fifty is a quite short but very challenging game, with constantly spawning enemies attacking from all sides.</desc>

Each maze must be completed within a tight time limit and a number of traps and obstacles litter the mazes to slow players down.

There are, however, a number of positive targets to be hit, and bonuses - such as additional time - can be found hidden away within the mazes. When the ball is stuck or the player would like to speed up, the JUMP button can be used. If the player runs out of time before reaching the goal, a random matching game is run to allow the player more time to complete the maze. This challenge, however is very difficult to win.</desc>

		<desc>Caveman Ninja is a horizontally-scrolling platform beat-em-up set in prehistoric times with one or two players taking on the roles of cavemen Joe and Mac. Rival caveman have invaded Joe and Mac's village and kidnapped all of their women and it's up to the two heroes to venture forth and save them. 

Joe and Mac must battle through numerous prehistorically-themed stages, fighting enemy cavemen and marauding dinosaurs. The heroes are initially armed with throwing axes that can be tossed either vertically or horizontally, travelling in a short arc. By holding down the attack button, larger, more powerful weapons will be thrown. When close to an enemy, Joe and Mac will utilise a wooden club to whack them. Players can also jump much higher by holding UP and JUMP.

Joe and Mac each have a life meter that gradually depletes over time, with additional energy losses incurred when players are hit by a enemies or projectile. Food can be collected from defeated enemies to top up the players' energy levels. Different weapons can be found throughout the stages including stone wheels, fireballs, and shadowy doppelgangers that charge forward and attack enemies. Other power-ups include hot sauce or jalapeno peppers that give players temporary invincibility and fiery breath. 

Certain enemy strikes - such as being hit by a thrown boulder - will flatten Joe and Mac like pancakes for a few seconds, although they can still move and attack while in this form, albeit more slowly. During the simultaneous two-player game, both characters are capable of damaging each other. The game allows players to select between different routes after each boss battle. Also, after defeating the final boss, the players can choose between three exits, each one leading to a slightly different ending sequence.</desc>

		<name>Centipede</name>
		<desc>Centipede is a vertically oriented single screen shoot-em-up in which the aim is to use the 'Bug Blaster' to shoot the centipedes that snake down towards the bottom of the screen to amass as high a score as possible. 

The play-field is littered with randomly placed mushrooms and the rapidly descending Centipede changes direction when it runs into a mushroom. When a segment of the Centipede is shot, the segment is destroyed and a mushroom appears in its place, the Centipede then breaks into two smaller centipedes, each with its own head, and continues its descent. 

Players can move the Bug Blaster vertically as well as horizontally, although only for the lower fifth of the play-field. Mushrooms can also be shot for points and to clear blocked areas. Once a Centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it starts snaking back up, but remains within the lower section of the play-field near the player's Bug Blaster.

Additionally, any Centipede that reaches the very bottom of the screen without being shot releases its tail section which then becomes a new head. Other new heads also enter the screen from the bottom corners of the play-field as time progresses.

Randomly moving Spiders also appear in the first wave. Spiders can destroy any mushrooms they move over, eliminating many mushroom targets for a player. If the Bug Blaster and a Spider collide, both are destroyed. the Spider either moves at a 45-degree angle or vertically up and down, never simply left or right like the centipede does.

A bombardment of Fleas appears from the second wave onward. As a Flea descends, it leaves a trail of new mushrooms behind it. Fleas appear when a certain number of mushrooms remains at the bottom of the screen. This number increases as the game progresses, meaning Fleas appear more often later on in the game. The Bug Blaster must hit a Flea twice to destroy it; the first shot simply speeds up its descent.

When a Centipede with fewer than eleven segments appears, a Scorpion enters from either side, moving at a relatively slow speed. As the player earns more points, the Scorpion's speed increases. As the Scorpion travels across the screen, it 'poisons' the mushrooms that it moves over and changes their colours. These mushrooms cause any Centipedes that would collide with them to head straight towards the bottom of the screen, rather than continue snaking left and right. The Bug Blaster can stop a poisoned Centipede by shooting its head.

If a player earns at least 60,000 points, two things happen to increase the challenge: the Fleas descend at a faster speed and the Spiders restrict their movement to a smaller area at the bottom of the screen.</desc>

The game puts the player in the role of Mr. Chack'n, who must rescue all of the hearts that were stolen during a romantic interlude between him and Miss Chack'n. Chack is an interesting character with interesting abilities. He can toss two bombs, only one in each direction at a time. He can also effortlessly go from walking on the floor to walking on the ceiling. If the ceiling is low enough, Chack can extend his legs until his head touches the ceiling to immediately begin walking on it.</desc>

The quicker the bombs are defused the more points will be earned. At the same time the player has to watch out for the stomping boots that move around the grid. Any contact with these will lead to the player getting killed and a life will be lost. In addition to bombs and boots there are also skulls which are stationary obstacles and flags which give bonus points. It is possible to slide the row of squares the player is standing on left or right as long as there is space left and the objects are not moved off the edge of the screen.</desc>

		<desc>Clutch Hitter is a baseball game originally released for Sega System 18 hardware before being ported to the Sega Game Gear. The Game Gear version was only released in North America.

There are noticeable differences between the Japanese and US versions of the arcade game - the US version has a MLB license and uses US teams, while the Japanese version opts for Japanese players and teams. There are also subtle changes to the presentation to reflect the two regions. A Chicken Leg, an enemy seen in Altered Beast and Golden Axe, makes a cameo appearance in the results screen.

Clutch Hitter is considered to be an entry in the Super League series of baseball games, directly inspiring the improvements Pro Yakyuu Super League '91 made to Super League.</desc>

		<desc>In Colony 7 the player must defend Colony 7 from alien attack by either using the main weapons that fire shots, a Mega-Blaster which knocks out targets near the detonation zone, or with the Eradicator that acts as a smartbomb which clears the entire screen. There is an ion shield which provides temporary safety for the colony below, but can be blasted away by alien fire.

Colony 7 is in many ways a combination of two of the most popular shoot 'em up games of the time, containing elements of both Tehkan's Pleiads and Atari's Missile Command. The main innovation of Colony 7 was the extended weaponry arsenal. This gave the player the choice to change between several different weapons, with the the Eradicator needing to be purchased separately as "extended weaponry".</desc>

Joe's mission is to rescue captives and destroy the enemy bases and strongholds that appear at the end of each level, killing as many enemy soldiers as possible in the process. 

The end-of-level strongholds see waves of enemy soldiers ordered to attack by a cowardly officer, who immediately runs away. Shooting the fleeing officer earns the player bonus points. Along the way, players can attempt to free prisoners-of-war by shooting their enemy guard escorts as they are transported across the screen.

Super Joe carries only two weapons: a limited-range machine gun with unlimited shots, and a limited supply of hand grenades. Extra grenades can be picked up as the player progresses through the levels.</desc>

Two years later, a terrorist organization calling themselves Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.

'Contra' is a hectic one or two player platform shoot-em-up featuring 10 stages. In addition to the standard side-view levels, there are also "3D maze" stages in which the player must proceed through a series of corridors inside an enemy base, destroying various sensors, in order to reach the core of the base.

Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.

		<name>Crush Roller</name>
		<desc>Crush Roller is a maze game in which the player controls a paintbrush and must paint the entire layout in order to advance to the next stage. Two fish  one yellow, the other light blue  emerge from separate aquariums to pursue the paintbrush around the board, and if either of the fish succeeds in making contact with the paintbrush, the player loses a life.

The player may use two "rollers" to attack the fish. The rollers are located on two overpasses, one vertical in its orientation, the other horizontal. To use a roller, the player positions the paintbrush on the forward end of the roller, waits for either or both of the fish to approach, then pushes the paintbrush along the roller, attacking the fish. The fish is removed from the maze for a few seconds, then returns to one of the aquariums and resumes its pursuit of the paintbrush. Killing fish in this manner scores bonus points.

A third character, appearing to be an animal or human figure depending on the level, may enter the maze and leave tracks that must be painted over in order for the board to be completed. The player can limit the damage by running over the figure, which not only stops further tracks from being left but also awards the player a score, which progressively increases as more boards are cleared.</desc>

		<name>Defender</name>
		<desc>Defender is a legendary sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up - the very first of its genre - in which the aim is to pilot a laser-firing spaceship and protect humanoids stranded on the planet's surface from swarms of alien abductors.

A long-range scanner at the top of the screen shows the positions of both the humanoids and the attacking aliens. The ideal strategy is to shoot down the alien ships before they reach the humanoids. If a humanoid is captured, the alien abductor can still be destroyed, but the player must then catch the falling humanoid and return it to the safety of the planet's surface before it falls to its death.

If an alien is allowed to carry its victim to the very top of the screen, the humanoid will mutate, becoming a permanent part of the alien that captured it. This new and deadly mutation will then immediately join in the alien attack.

The challenge becomes more intense as action progresses. Fighter ships and their mines will soon join the abductors. There are also mother ships that must be destroyed; these are particularly difficult as a direct hit smashes the mother ship into a swarming mass of mini-ships that must also be wiped out. Throughout the entire mission, the player must act quickly or face possible destruction by the cosmic baiter, a fast and dangerous enemy.

Players have two escape options to use as a last resort. The first is the 'smart bomb', which destroys all on-screen enemies. The second option is 'hyperspace', which randomly teleports the player's ship to another part of the level. This is highly risky as it may place the player's ship in a position more dangerous than the one it left.

If all humanoids are successfully abducted, the planet will explode in a blinding flash and the waves remaining until the next planet is reached take place in outer space, and consist solely of destroying enemy waves.</desc>

		<name>Diamond Run</name>
		<desc>An arcade puzzle game in which a single player must tunnel their way through a number of underground caves, collecting the many gems spread throughout the levels. Each cave is littered with rocks which, should they fall onto the player, will result in a loss of life. Carefully planned tunnels can be dug to manipulate the direction in which the rocks fall, however, which makes them an effective weapon against the many enemies that populate the levels. A number of red explosives can be found which can also be used to kill enemies and also to destroy any walls blocking the player's path. Again, like the rocks, these must be used carefully to prevent the explosion from killing the player.

In order to complete a level, a specified number of gems must be collected. Once a sufficient amount of gems have been collected, an exit will open which the player must enter to proceed to the next cave.

Diamond Run is heavily based on First Star's Commodore C64 classic, 'Boulder Dash'.</desc>

The action now takes place on a series of small islands, the gameplay itself retains much from its predecessor, with Dig Dug still being chased by the 'Pookas' (round, goggle-wearing red enemies) and the 'Fygers' (green, fire-breathing dragons).

As with the first game, Dig Dug is still armed with a pump that allows him to inflate and burst the enemies. For the sequel, however, he is also armed with a jackhammer. This can be used at the round ground-pegs scattered around each island to create and connect up fault lines in the ground. If both ends of a system of faults reaches the water, the ground surrounded by them will sink into the ocean killing all creatures on it, including Dig Dug himself if he is standing on the destroyed section of land.</desc>

		<name>Do! Run Run</name>
		<desc>A superb final entry into the "Mr Do!" series (not counting the Neo Geo-based "Neo Mr. Do", which was merely a remake of the first game in the series), "Do! Run Run" takes its inspiration from Namco's "Pac-Man".

As in his previous games, Mr Do! must once again collect coloured dots and/or fruit while avoiding or killing a number of enemies. For the fourth Mr Do! outing, Universal ditched the sideways viewpoint of the series' previous games and switched to an overhead perspective. This allowed the game to give an impression of 'depth', with slopes and steps affecting Mr Do!'s mobility and speed.

Mr. Do. has two items at his disposal with which he can kill the his enemies. The first is the 'Powerball', which featured in the original 'Mr. Do!' but was dropped from the first two sequels. The Powerball can be shot directly at an enemy to kill it instantly.

The second offensive option is provided in the form of the large wooden logs that litter the levels. These work in the same way as the apples did in the original game, and can be pushed free of their supporting struts, causing them to roll down the screen and kill everything in their path, including Mr. Do. himself if he strays too near.

As Mr Do! moves around a screen, he trails a line behind him. Players can join the two ends of the line up to form a rectangle (in a similar fashion to Taito's 1981 classic, "Qix") which will change any dots within the rectangle into cherries. A second rectangle can be drawn around the cherries which in turn will change them into apples. This can be repeated twice more, changing apples into lemons, and lemons into pineapples. The better the fruit, the more bonus points Mr Do! will earn when he collects them.</desc>

		<desc>The player controls Domino Man, a bespectacled, moustachioed artist who must set up a chain of giant dominoes across the screen, to form a chain of dominoes which can then be toppled.

The dominoes must be placed on sites marked by black spots, achieved by simply running over each spot. Once all of the spots are covered with a domino, the chain is complete. The player will then have the choice of either knocking them all down to clear the level, or simply wait for a few seconds to continue to the next screen, in hope of completing the chain on THAT level, and so on. In this way, the player can set up several chains and knock them all down in one fell swoop, earning many bonus points in the process. Multiple chains are, of course, very difficult to achieve.

Domino Man's progress is hampered by a neighborhood bully who walks onto the screen and tries to knock over the first dominoes he comes across. The player must either try to complete and topple the chain of dominoes before the bully knocks them over, or hit the bully with a domino; causing the bully's trousers to fall down and disabling him for a few seconds. A killer bee also appears, and if it manages to sting the player, a life is lost. A bag lady and a boy pushing a shopping cart wander blindly around the levels, occasionally knocking over some of the dominoes. Domino Man can hit them, however, causing them to change direction.

Once a game is over, a poem is displayed on-screen to evaluate the player's performance on the game. For example:
Roses are red
Or so goes the verse
You set up fifty-two
You could have done worse.</desc>

SNORT" Foreboding music warns of the eventual doom that awaits the poor girl, lest she somehow be miraculously rescued. "But, wait! Fear not, fair maiden. Little Mario, the carpenter, is in hot pursuit of you this very moment"

Throwing fate to the wind, risking life and limb, or worse, little Mario tries desperately to climb the mighty fortress of steel, to save the lovely lady from the evil Mr. Kong. Little Mario must dodge all manner of obstacles - fireballs, plummeting beams and a barrage of exploding barrels fired at him by Donkey Kong.

Amidst me beautiful girl's constant pleas for help, your challenge is to maneuver little Mario up the steel structure, while helping him to avoid the rapid-fire succession of hazards that come his way.

As little Mario gallantly battles his way up the barriers, he is taunted and teased by Donkey Kong, who brazenly struts back and forth, beating his chest in joyful exuberance at the prospect of having the beautiful girl all to himself. It is your job to get little Mario to the top. For it is there, and only there, that he can send the mighty Donkey Kong to hit mortal doom. Leaving little Mario and the beautiful girl to live happily ever after. "SIGH. SIGH.”

So, if you want the most exciting, most fun-filled, most talked about family video game on the market, don't monkey around with anything but the original Donkey Kong.</desc>

		<desc>Fate has turned the tables on the inimitable Donkey Kong.

After Mario saved the Beautiful Girl from the lustful clutches of Donkey Kong, he led the brokenhearted ape into captivity, locking him behind steel bars, never again to strut his stuff before the fair maidens of the world.

As the frustration of confinement enrages Donkey Kong, Mario complacently stands guard over the cell, holding the sought after key to freedom.

But wait! Unbeknownst to Little Mario, Donkey Kong has produced an offspring - Donkey Kong Junior! A death-defying little monkey, shrewd and cunning, who resists all enemies to rescue Papa Donkey Kong.

As Mario's brigade of snapping jaws, ape-eating birds and energy pods launch their offensive, Junior bombards them with a fusillade of Fruit Bombs that aim to annihilate his every foe.</desc>

		<desc>An excellent vertically scrolling shoot'em up. The player assumes the role of a pilot who is sent by their squadron to fight their former allies until one side destroys the other, all of which is a part of a mission to strengthen the military power that controls each side. The player flies their selected fighter over 5 areas of various terrain, encountering a number of land, sea and air enemies. The player's ship has two modes of fire: by tapping the fire button, shots are fired; holding it down produces a concentrated vertical beam, but also reduces the ship's speed.

The player can choose one of 3 aircraft at the start of the game, or upon continuing:
Type A: A red (or yellow/orange, for player two) fighter, which fires a narrow stream of shots
Type B: A green (or purple, for player two) helicopter, which fires its main guns forward, but has side guns that rotate in the direction of movement
Type C: A blue (or black, for player two) fighter, which fires a wide, three-way spread of shots</desc>

There are ten characters to choose from, including Billy and Jimmy and the game has colorful interactive backgrounds, screen zooming, over-the-top special moves and with the inclusion of double jumps, combos, charges for the losing player and counter hits, there is plenty of room for advanced fighting strategies.</desc>

		<name>Double Dragon 3 - The Rosetta Stone</name>
		<desc>A mysterious fortune teller warns Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee about the rise of a powerful enemy in Egypt. Since the Lee brothers are looking for a true challenge to put their martial arts skills to the ultimate test, they agree to face this mysterious new enemy. They embark on a world quest - joining up with new allies in the process - and try to lay claim to the famous 'Rosetta Stone'.

The 3rd and final arcade entry of the Double Dragon series (not counting the later Neo-Geo fighting game based on the movie) features a completely gameplay system and graphics from the first two installments. The game can played by up to 2 or 3 players, depending on the cabinet and settings. The 3rd player takes control of a yellow-clad Lee brother named Sonny, who is exclusive to this game. Techniques from the previous games such as the hair grab and the elbow punch are gone, but new ones are added such as the belly-to-back throw and the back-to-back hurricane kick, as well as the ability to dash by tapping the joystick left or right twice.

The game features weapon shops that allows the player to purchase power-ups by inserting additional tokens. The power-ups differ between stages differ between stages and are available as followed.
Extra Guys - Allows the player to control a new character who replaces the current fighter when he dies. There are three character types in addition to the Lee brothers.
The Urquidez Brothers (Roney, Sunny, Jonny) -  Tall European grapplers. They have the most energy of the four character types.  Up to three fighters can be have in reserve.
The Chin Brothers (Seimei, Taimei, Sinmei) - Chubby Chinese men with powerful attacks.
The Oyama Brothers (Masao, Kunio, Akira) - Japanese karate masters dressed in gis specializing in speedy attacks.
? Tricks - The hurricane kick and the one-armed stand head butt are added to the player's move set. If the player's current character dies, then the new techniques will be inherited by the next character in reserve, if there is one.
Weapons - A nunchaku or sword are given player. Only the Lees can have purchase and wield weapons.
Energy - Restores the current character's life to 150%.
Power-Up - Increases the character's agility.

There are 5 stages in the game:

Mission 1 - America - The enemies in this stage are typical thugs and bikers. The first area takes place in a downtown area of city. After defeating the first wave of enemies, the player will enter a warehouse, where they encounter bikers that will try to run over them with their bike. The boss in this is Jim, a red-haired biker wearing a leather jacket.

Mission 2 - China - The enemies are martial artists that specialize in flying kicks. The stage takes place in a single level set in a countryside near the Great Wall of China. The boss at the end of level is Li Cheng-Long, a Shaolin Martial Arts expert who resembles Bruce Lee. When he's down in life, he will wield out his club.

Mission 3 - Japan - The enemies are samurai swordsmen. The first area takes place outside a castle, with bamboo traps and enemies coming out of walls. The second area takes place inside a castle, where the player will face a few more swordsmen before taking out on the boss, Ranzou, a ninja. He attacks with throwing stars and smoke bombs and splits into three forms when he's down on his life.

Mission 4 - Italy - Consists of a single level set in the ruins of a coliseum. The enemies are roman archers. After defeating most of the archers, the boss Giuliano, a man decked in gladiator armor, will attempt to run the player over with his horse. After defeating all the archers, Giuliano will dismount at the end of the level and fight the player. He wields a long hand spear and can block attacks with his shield.

		<name>Double Dragon II - The Revenge</name>
		<desc>Following his defeat at the end of the original Double Dragon, Willy, the leader of the Black Warriors, retaliates against Billy and Jimmy Lee by murdering their friend, Marian, leaving the brothers with the task to avenge her death.

The sequel to Double Dragon is essentially an upgraded version of the original game, but with with a two-way attacking system similar to one previously used in Technos Japan's 1986 arcade game "Renegade". Many of the attacks and combos from the original "Double Dragon" are retained, as well as new techniques including the invincible Cyclone Kick.

The stages and weapons are redesigned versions of items previously featured in the original game. There are a few new traps such as a bulldozer in the middle of Mission 3 and all of the transition sequences between stages are now done with the character entering the next level via a lift, making it impossible to carry one weapon to the next area.

Most of the enemy characters return from the original Double Dragon, with some given facelifts, but the stage bosses are all new. The enemies are as followed:
Williams - Has a wilder face and longer hair. He can now run towards the player and do cartwheels. He throws his knives in mid-air and sometimes carry a shovel which he throws towards the player.
Rowper - Has a beard and eye-patch, but otherwise is more or less identical to his original self. He carries shovels and can sometime pick up large objects.
Linda - She now has a mohawk and face paint. She can also jump off platforms and do the elbow strike against the player. In addition to the ball and chain, she also carries grenades and knives.
Oharra - A strongman with a clean-shaved face. Replaces Abobo from the first game and has the same attacks.
Bolo - A head-swap of Oharra with long hair and beard. Replaces the mohawked head-swap of Abobo from the first game.
Jeff - Same as his original self, but now carries grenades.
Burnov - The boss of Mission 1. An obese wrestler whose face is concealed with a mask. He grabs the player and throws similar punches in the face. After dying, he will stand up and yell, disappearing in front of the player and leaving only his clothes. In later encounters, he will revive himself at least once.
Abore - The boss of Mission 2. A huge suspender-wearing strongman with Terminator-like sunglasses. His slaps and shoulder tackles do massive damage to the player.
Chin Taimei - The boss of Mission 3. A Chinese martial artists armed with twin kali sticks. In addition to his energy-draining stick combo, he also has a jump kick and sweep kick.
Willy - The boss of Mission 4. Looks like he does in the original game, but now dresses in red. He still uses the same machine gun from the first game.
The clone - After defeating Willy, the player will have to fight their character's evil self. This clone has all the techniques the player has, but can also throw energy beams and possess the player's body to drain his energy.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Breed</name>
		<desc>Dragon Breed is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player controls the game's hero, Kayus, who is riding on the back of a fully articulated dragon named 'Bahamoot'. The dragon is immune to enemy attacks, capable of blocking most projectiles and of damaging and eventually killing enemies on contact. Dragon rider Kayus is armed with a forward-firing crossbow but unlike his steed, is not invulnerable and will be killed by contact with either enemies or their projectiles. 

What separates Dragon Breed from other games in the genre is in how the Dragon can be utilised. Bahamoot's body is flexible and responds to Kayus' movement, enabling Kayus to use Bahamoot as both a mobile shield and a whip-like weapon. It's also possible to encircle the tail around a group of enemies to kill them. The tail of the yellow or blue dragon can be coiled around the dragon's rider to offer almost complete invulnerability for a limited time.

Bahamoot can also spit fireballs. By holding the fire button down, the dragon will build up fire in its mouth; the longer the button is held down, the more powerful the fireball will be. There are four levels of fireball power and at its strongest, the fireball resembles a dragon's head.

Power-ups appear in the form of orbs, acquired by shooting small green dragons that appear intermittently throughout stages. There are four different types of orbs, each of will change Bahamoot to a different colour and grant him a new attack power: 
Red orb enables the dragon to breathe a flame. 
Gold orb enables Bahamoot's body to fire crescents in all directions. 
Silver orb enables the dragon to produce up to four miniature dragons, which home in on enemies. 
Blue orb enables Bahamoot to fire bolts of electricity downwards from its underside. 

The player can enhance a specific power by picking up the same type of orb, this can be done up to three times. 

Dragon Breed also includes platforming elements. At certain points during a stage horizontal platforms appear, these often have power-ups on them and the dragon rider can dismount and run along the platforms while the dragon waits above.</desc>

		<name>E-swat - Cyber Police</name>
		<desc>Cyber Police ESWAT is a 1989 scrolling shooter arcade game developed and published by Sega. Players take control of Duke Oda, a member of the Liberty City Cyber Police Force tasked with finding and arresting the city's most wanted criminals, and eventually dismantling a terrorist organization planning world domination.

The gameplay is very similar to Sega's own Shinobi, as the player has the ability to jump up and down between planes where possible. The goal of each of the game's 15 stages is to find and arrest a specific wanted criminal, who is usually fought at the end of the stage as a boss. Duke is initially armed with only a single-shot pistol, but upon arresting the first three criminals and being promoted to ESWAT, Duke is equipped with a Power Suit with a mounted machine gun for the rest of the game. The suit also has access to limited-use special weapons which can be found within stages. However, both of Duke's standard weapons require ammunition, without which the player can only attack with a kick. Additional ammunition can be found in boxes throughout each stage.</desc>

		<name>Enduro Racer</name>
		<desc>Enduro Racer is an off-road racing game in which players ride a dirt bike across five extremely hilly and twisting courses. Each course is littered with logs, rocks, trees and rival racers that must be either jumped over or avoided.

Jumps can only be performed at specific locations on each track. These locations feature a dirt ramp that spreads across the width of the track. Players must have the bike in the 'wheelie' position when the ramp is struck, the bike will then be launched into the air. If the bike is not in a wheelie position when the ramps are struck, the bike will still clear the ramp, but will land front-wheel first and crash.

Enduro Racer is perhaps best remembered for its 'Wheelie' feature, which required the player to physically lift the cabinet's handlebars to raise the front wheel of the game's on-screen counterpart.</desc>

An unusual take on the overhead racing genre, Escape Kids has up to 4 players taking on the role of an athletic runner and competing to be the first to cross the finish line in a number of 3-lap races. As well as running, each player has a limited number of &amp;#039;Super Jumps&amp;#039;; these allow the player to leap over both rival runners and obstacles.

Money is awarded for finishing first, and players can upgrade their runner depending on the amount of money they have available. Runners can be given extra super jumps, an upgrade to stop the runner from skidding when going through a bend in the track, quicker recovery time from falls, or be made stronger (and thus less likely to be knocked over by a rival runner). Special items occasionally appear and can be picked up and used. These range from an item that causes a small earthquake (causing all of the rival runners to tumble along the ground, thus slowing them down) and a bomb, which renders any runner that runs into it unable to move for several seconds.

Each race has a total of five competitors (either human or computer controlled) and players must finish in first place or are disqualified. Any player who wins all three races in a round will be taken to a bonus screen. Here, the player&amp;#039;s on-screen counterpart rides a bike and the player must collect as much money as possible.</desc>

		<desc>ESP Ra.De. is a 1998 arcade game developed by Cave and published by Atlus. It is the first non-DonPachi game released by Cave. ESP Ra.De. received spiritual prequels in the form of the Espgaluda series; however, ESP Ra.De. is related to the Espgaluda series only by shared name and programmer Tsuneki Ikeda.

By 2018, Tokyo has reached its maximum extension, therefore falling prey of common problems such as overpopulation and criminality. For this reason, an artificial island, aptly named Tokyo-2, is created just offshore, thanks to the support of the shady "Yaksa" corporation, led by elusive billionaire Garra Ono, whose ties with the modern incarnation of Yakuza have not been proven. Another source of instability is given by the rising number of humans exhibiting extrasensory perception, the so-called ESPers, who are constantly hunted down by the Japanese Police Force. Unknown to everyone, Garra herself is an extremely powerful ESPer, bent on using her influence over the government and military to replace every living being in the city with clones (disturbingly enough, these ESPers take the form of a 10 years old girl, named "Alice" and implied to originate from Garra's own DNA). Just as her plans begin to unfold, three children are forced to take action, each one for his or her own personal motives.

The story takes place in December, during a 24-hour arc; each character has a specific stage which initiates his or her storyline, culminating with the final encounter.</desc>

In an otherwise peaceful world, the Shinra Empire began conquering nearby nations one by one to expand their territory gradually. Meanwhile, in the Shinra weapons lab, the Espgaluda project produced two successful prototypes: Agaha and Tateha. Fearing for their future, the project's head scientist, Hiodoshi, escaped with the two prototypes to a nearby kingdom, but time after were found by Shinra's troops and Hiodoshi was killed by the attack of the imperial army, the power of the galuda has awaken. 

You have the option of controlling one of two siblings each with different skills, Ageha  faster but with narrower shooting capabilities or Tateha slower but with a wider attack. As you fly through the various stages various mechanical enemies attack with a high number of bullets, often nearly filling the screen. Aside from the regular shots, Ageha and Tateha also have additional abilities which help the player navigate through the numerous bullets. The first is a guard barrier; when activated the player is immune to collisions and as a bonus when the barrier button is released a more powerful laser shot is fired. A meter at the bottom of the screen indicates how much power is left in the barrier. The second ability is called the Kakusei mode; when this mode is activated your character gender is altered and is able to fire a more powerful shot. More importantly, when this mode is activated all of the enemies and their bullets slow down considerably while the players speed remains the same making it easier to navigate through a tricky pattern of bullets. Activating Kakusei mode will rapidly deplete the players supply of green gems; since the number of gems isn't limitless the player may not be able to remain in Kakusei mode for long. When not in Kakusei mode additional gems can be collected by destroying the various enemies. If the player completely runs out of gems, enemy bullets begin travelling faster than usual. Another bonus in the game is gold inguts which greatly increase the players score. These are found when in Kakusei mode; when an enemy is destroyed, all of its bullets will turn into ingots which can be collected by the player.</desc>

The players must take up control of four medieval lords who are fighting for control of the land. They have to battle through eight different castles, and try to gain control of each one. When one of the lords wins a battle, he shall receive a medal - and once he has won three medals, he will gain control of the current castle (which means that they can be up to six rooms long) and the game will proceed to the next castle.

		<name>Fighter's History</name>
		<desc>Fighter's History is the first attempt of Data East to enter in competition with Capcom and its omnipresent Street Fighter II. Because the many similarities shared by the game with the Capcom masterpiece (like the character select screen, the vs and winner/loser screens, the controls and the design and moves of some characters), Fighter's History was at least simply stamped by most of the  players like another SFII clone, and in this way remained ignored and obscured to the mass audience.

Although time after, the many beat'em up fans learnt to appreciate this maybe too underestimated fighting game, especially for its combo system, quite simple to execute even for those players not so able with timing and button pressing, and for its fast gameplay: at this purpose most of the contribution was made by the updated version released in 1994, Fighter's History Dynamite (known as Karnov's Revenge in USA and Europe) that made the gameplay more polished. Despite this at least Fighter's History never reached that great success that maybe Data East still tried to achieve.

Players choose one of 9 international fighters and battle to be the best in the world. Every character has his ending sequence and his own stage. There are also two not-selectable bosses to challenge for reach the end, and the last one of them is real surprising!</desc>

Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters, Guy, Cody, and Haggar, each with his own fighting style and attributes. Guy is the weakest but has faster attacks, Haggar is the strongest but also the slowest, and Cody has all-round attributes.

Final Fight consists of six stages or "rounds", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a boss character unique to that round.</desc>

However, if one of the players cannot manage to successfully complete his current lap of the track before the time runs out, his or her game will instantly be over and the race will continue without them. 

The players must complete between three and six full laps of the track in order to win (the number is dependent on how both of the cabinets are set, as with Namco's own Final Lap). The players will also encounter between four and seven blue CPU-controlled bikes on the track, as the number is dependent on how many people are playing (seven for one player, six for two players, five for three, and four for four).</desc>

		<name>Gaia Crusaders</name>
		<desc>Gaia Crusaders is a one or two-player side-scrolling beat-em-up in which players must battle Satan and his army of demons that have captured and taken over the world. Players select a character from a choice of five combatants known as 'Elemental Warriors'. Each of the characters possesses either Wind strength, Fire strength, or a mix of the two. 

The game has the standard punch and kick attack moves as well as magical special moves. Combos can be strung together by switching quickly between kicking and punching. Players can also perform a 'super attack' by pressing the jump, punch and kick buttons simultaneously, this hits many enemies at once but costs the player character some health. It's also possible to raise a shield by pressing jump and kick simultaneously.

At regular intervals coloured spheres appear, players can pick these up to gain a magical attack. The effects of the magic attack differs depending on the player character. If the magic matches the character's elemental attribute (fire, wind or both), they will gain a special, screen-clearing attack. Otherwise, they earn a powerful special attack. 

In addition to the elemental spheres, there are two types of bombs that also appear, both of which detonate immediately once picked up. The first is an earthquake that hits all on-screen enemies and inflicts a large amount of damage. The second is a random bomb that sends out pillars of fire, hurting any enemies they come into contact with. There are also explosive boxes that can be kicked at enemies to keep them at bay. One last notable item is the sword, which functions much like weapons that can be found on the ground in many other beat 'em ups. A boss battle awaits players at the end of each stage.

Gaia Crusaders is heavily influenced by another scrolling beat-em-up, Capcom's 1989 classic, Final Fight and also, to a lesser degree, by Sega's Golden Axe (the latter being the use of the Magical Attack acting as a smart bomb).

		<desc>Galaga '88 is an updated version of the old favorite, "Galaga", with more invaders and more player firepower. Galaga '88 gives players a chance to once again repel the invaders from the Galagan Kingdom. One or two players can try their hand at fighting the invaders. This time the Galagans have four more allies, each with unique weapons and defenses that a player must overcome. 

By destroying special enemies or obstacles the player can get 'items'. When a player has two items, they can warp to another dimension to confront more Galagan ships with new strategies. In the Challenging Stages (labelled in this game as 'That's Galactic Dancin'), the player shoots down as many invaders as possible as the Galagans dance to a waltz, tango, march or jazz tune. 

The player selects single or dual ship power. The objective is to destroy all the Galagan foes in each of the 29 sectors of the galaxy, with each sector more difficult than the last. 

Unique Features: 
More opponents. In addition to Boss, Goei and Zako, the original Galagan crew, Don, Nin, Ban, and Gan have been added. Each of the Galagans has a unique way of challenging the players. 
Different types of ships. Players can choose single or dual ships (if the game option is set for dual and single). When the player retrieves a dual ship from the Boss's tractor beam, it turns into a triple ship with ten times the power of a single ship. 
Challenging Stages. In the 'That's Galactic Dancin' stages, the Galagan invaders dance to a waltz, tango, Sousa march or jazz tune, while the player shoots down Galagans to earn bonus points. 
Warping to a new dimension. By destroying particular enemies or obstacles and capturing two of their items, the player can warp to the next dimension. 
Player challenge. Each dimension has different mix of Galagans with different strategies to be overcome. 
Win back captured ships. The player can win back ships captured in the Boss Galaga's tractor beam. When the player destroys the Boss, the ships are released. If the player retrieves them, the ships become dual ships if they were single and triple if they were dual. 
High Score Mode. Upon completing a game, a player can enter his initials if they are among the top eight scorers on the game.</desc>

		<name>Gals Panic</name>
		<desc>Gals Panic! is a "Qix"-style adult puzzle game.  The objective is to reveal 80% of the silhouetted girl's image within the time limit while avoiding the enemies.

To complicate things, there is a bar with a pointer at the top of the screen. If the pointer dips below a certain level (indicated by the change in color) the image will change to that of a monster. The pointer slowly creeps towards the monster side of the bar over time and whenever the player reveals a significant piece of the silhouette.  Revealing the un-silhouetted part of the image moves the pointer back towards the girl side of the bar.  If a round is completed while the monster's image is shown then the round must be repeated.

After every round there is a roulette game where the player can earn rewards or penalties that will take effect in the following round.

After winning three rounds against a girl, the graphic becomes a photographic image of that girl.</desc>

If the player reveals 100% of the silhouetted image, then he is shown a series of different photos of the current girl before continuing on to the next stage.  Between stages there are mini-games where the player can win the chance to see an image of another girl.</desc>

		<desc>Gals Panic 4 is a variant of the classic puzzle game qix where the player works to uncover the highlighted area of the play space to reveal a girl. Players select one of seven girls at the start of the game.  Each girl has three stages with each stage featuring a different background image to uncover. Players are given bombs to attack the enemies with and are rewarded with more bombs if they reveal a large section at one time. When a player reveals 80% of a girl the stage ends and the player is shown the entire background image. When a player reveals 100% of the girl in a stage, he is rewarded with a 'Showtime' interlude.  Unlike in later games, 'Showtime' sequences involve no nudity, they just show the girl in a bikini. The 'Showtime' image is the same for each level featuring the girl.

There is also a 2-player vs. game where both players work on separate images on a split screen and work to reveal their image first. When a player uses a bomb in this game, instead of attacking the enemy, it sends a sub-enemy to the other player's side.</desc>

The game begins with a stage select screen. The girls in series fly to the middle of the screen from the four corners until one is selected.  Once a stage is selected the object is to cover the colored area of the girl, while avoiding the monsters and their weapons. The stage is completed once 80% of the girl is revealed. At 90% uncovered, the player is treated to the SHOWTIME image of the girl posed in her panties and bra.  At 100% revealed, the player is rewarded with the SHOWTIME DX image revealing her in a different pose without her bra. Unlike in previous games in the Gals Panic S series, SHOWTIME DX is a static image and NOT a video clip.</desc>

		<name>Gauntlet</name>
		<desc>Gauntlet is a maze-based shoot-em-up for up to four players. Heavily influenced by classic fantasy conventions, players take on the role of either Thor the Warrior, Thyra the Valkyrie, Merlin the Wizard, or Questor the Elf and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes. Competitive play is encouraged as players must fight for the limited amount of food, treasure, magic potions and power-up items that litter the dungeons. 

Each of Gauntlet's four characters have different strengths and weaknesses: Thyra has the strongest armour, Thor is best at hand-to-hand combat, Questor has the fastest speed and Merlin has the most powerful magic attacks. The object of the game is simply to survive as long as possible while exploring Gauntlet's mazes in search of treasure, food, magic potions and, ultimately, the exit that leads to the next dungeon. 

The potions - shown as blue bottles - that litter the levels offer either improved character abilities (such as 'speed' or 'extra shot power') or can be used as a 'smart bomb', destroying some or all of the on-screen monsters. Potions are also the only way to kill the game's 'Death' character that appears in many of the stages. Magic potions can be kept and used at the player's discretion by pressing 'Magic' button, although each potion can only be used once. 

The first seven mazes are always the same, but from level 8 onwards, players will find themselves on any one of over a hundred different mazes. If players survive for long enough, the mazes will be repeated in a different order. How long a player lasts depends upon the player's 'health' level. Health continually depletes as time progresses and further health is lost by contact with various monsters or their projectiles. Health can be replenished by consuming the food found in the mazes or by inserting more credits. The many treasure chests that litter the levels can be plundered for points, and collecting treasure increases a player's score multiplier when two or more players are playing the game.</desc>

		<name>Gauntlet 2</name>
		<desc>Gauntlet II is a direct sequel to the legendary maze-based fantasy themed shoot-em-up, released a year earlier. Atari chose not to tinker with the core game-play mechanic to any great degree, opting instead to enhance the already excellent multi-player action that had created such a stir upon the original game's release.

As with its prequel, up to four players once again take on the role of either 'Thor the Warrior', 'Thyra the Valkyrie', 'Merlin the Wizard', or 'Questor the Elf' and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes, collecting potions, food and treasure as they searched for the exit that would lead them to the next dungeon.

Changes to the sequel included the ability for players to play whatever character they wanted, even if that character was already in play. Characters were now colour-coded and players would find themselves taking on the role of 'Blue Elf', 'Green Wizard', etc. New in-game speech was added to allow for the new player definitions.

Other changes included the ability to 'bounce' shots off walls - known as 'Reflective Shots' - providing the correct potion was picked up. As well as new potions, Gauntlet II also featured several new monsters. The most notorious of the new additions was the Fire-breathing Dragon that guards the exit to some dungeons. This powerful creature takes multiple hits to kill and defeating it would see the players rewarded with a permanent potion and a bag of treasure.

Another notable addition was the 'It' monster: any player who was tagged by the creature would suddenly find that all of that level's monsters would ONLY chase the tagged player, completely ignoring the presence of all other players. The only way to remove this curse was to tag another player, thus making them 'it'.

New level elements were also added to further increase variety. These included dungeons with entirely invisible walls, magical walls (which changed into monsters or items when hit), stun tiles (which stunned any player that walked on them) and exits that flashed between functioning and non-functioning.</desc>

The Dark Forces led by the god of destruction, Bacterian, prepare to launch a massive onslaught against the planet Gradius. Possessing unstoppable power, the Dark Forces threaten to plunge the Universe into total war and complete annihilation.

Their invasion force smashes the Gradius defenses, and the surrounding planets soon fall like dominoes. Now Bacterian's evil grasp reaches for the heart of the resistance...planet Gradius itself...

To counter the oncoming threat the United Gradius World Forces gather all their fighter craft. Half of them form a defensive net - the other half a strike team. But they are badly outnumbered and The Dark Forces easily tear through their thin frontline. No fighters survive the slaughter....

In a last gasp move, the United Gradius World Forces send out two fighters, previously considered too dangerous for combat missions: The InterDimensional VIC VIPER fighters.

The Fighters take off for the heart of darkness to join the fray that will decide the fate of the Universe...</desc>

		<desc>It is August 1999. In the skies over the Middle East, the second Persian Gulf War has begun. The early half of the 90's, the Persian Gulf War breaks out in the Middle East and prolonged fighting rapidly increases the rate of destruction of the world's natural resources. In 1999 this develops into a state of crisis where the effects of the war have resulted in an absolute shortage of reserves. Mistaken policies have resulted in the nation of the Middle East, suffering from shortages since the time of the original Persian Gulf War, taking military action against neighboring nations in an attempt to assure a supply of resources for themselves. Those nations which have managed to escape the fighting once again form a Multinational Force. Using the technology gained from research which had been done for a new type of nuclear reactor, they succeed in developing and producing GRID - a Gyrodrive Reactive Intercept Device. This is the start of Project Storm Hammer.</desc>

Like many game from Korea, Comad used the Gulf war theme in the 90's. This was a great theme, because based on the actuality, and the game sold very well (hundred thousand of boards)

		<name>Gun &amp; Frontier</name>
		<desc>The year is 2120: Earthlings have spread beyond their galaxy and have started to colonize uninhabited planets in different solar systems. One such planet to be colonized was the Earth-like planet Gloria which happened to have an enormous natural supply of gold. This discovery became pivotal to Gloria's emigration, so much that emigrators would be impoverished by the cost of reaching the planet. Because of this, life on the planet thrived in a setting similar to the American Old West. Though poor, the gold trade aided the Glorian's in advancing technology and knowledge, so much that among the inhabitants lived talented inventors and engineers.

However, the Glorian's were not the only ones who were tempted by the planet's gold: Space pirates known as the Wild Lizards quickly invade Gloria and decimate the towns of the people and enslave those who survived in an attempt to deplete the planet's gold supply. Two inventors of Gloria who were a part of the planet's development teams decide to strike back at their invaders using two fighter jets in the shape of giant revolvers with plane wings.

As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, Gun Frontier is very standard. Players start with dual machine guns which are strengthened and multiplied by upgrades that come in the shape of US dimes taken from buffalo shaped enemies and every five dimes empowers the ship's guns. Players also start with a bomb supply which is upgraded to further destruction by collecting gold bars from destroyed ground forces. Once a player accumulates 25 bombs, they are granted access to the Bomber Max, the strongest of the player's bombs.

The players can also pick up spinning coins with two different sides: a silver side and a gold side. If the player collects the coin on the silver side, then the player merely gains another coin for their guns. However, if the player collects the coin on the gold side, then the player's guns and bomb supply is maximized to full power.

A unique feature to the player's bombs is that the direction of the bomb's blast can be determined by the player's movement. If the player moves their plane to the lower right of the screen and launches their bombs, then the direction the bomb will travel in the opposite direction the plane's movement. This feature can only be used however when a player has a large bomb count as only having one or two bombs will result in a small directionless explosion. Like most bombs in shoot 'em ups, the bombs also work as a shield against enemy fire.

The game uses a check-point system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the check-point they died at.

Gun Frontier also employs an anti-autofire mechanism where the difficulty will max out by the second stage if the player is sustaining too fast of a fire rate.</desc>

Each level is packed with gun-toting bandits and the Sheriff must shoot his way through the stage, before finally taking on the wanted outlaw 'boss' character at the end. Each outlaw wields a special weapon unique to them, such as a Winchester rifle, knives, darts or boomerangs.

Shooting the barrels that litter the levels reveals power-ups such as boots (for extra speed), rifles (for increased range) and bullets (for rapid fire). The game's 3 directional fire buttons (for firing left, right or ahead) can be combined (pressed Simultaneously) to create a total of 8 different firing directions.</desc>

		<name>Gunbird</name>
		<desc>Gunbird is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up developed and published by Psikyo and released in Japanese arcades in 1994. It has been re-released multiple times, including on the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and Steam. When originally localized outside Japan by XS Games, Gunbird was retitled Mobile Light Force. The game was followed by Gunbird 2 in 1998 and was included in Gunbird Special Edition.

When a player collides with the body of an enemy unit, the player loses a shot power level, and a power up flies around the screen and disappears as soon as it reaches the edge. If a player is at the lowest level of shot, the player loses a bomb instead.
There are seven stages in each of the game's two loops. The first four stages are randomly chosen from possible five. In the second loop enemies fire denser bullet patterns moving at faster speeds. Stage 2-1 takes place at the only stage not available on the first loop, instead of the 1-1 counterpart. The remaining three stages are chosen at random, but does not include the replaced stage. After completing first loop with only one player, the player can choose one of two choices for a wish with a magic potion, with unique endings for each choice. If the first loop is completed with two players, a combination-specific ending is played.
The cutscenes between the battles with two players fighting cooperatively are frequently packed with hilarious dialogue and situations. This is often a recurring theme with Psikyo games, the Gunbird games being no exception. There are no cutscenes when playing second loop stages. The Korean arcade version contains English dialog but some sound samples are missing during play.

Gunbird uses manga-styled character as the player's chosen craft. A story plays out in between levels and before boss fights, telling a tale of how the protagonists are trying to collect pieces of a magic mirror to make a wish.
Ash: A 28-year-old German man with a jet pack on his back, who in some of the scenes between battles is discovered to be an inventor, and when two players choose Marion and Ash as cooperative partners, he takes an unhealthy interest in her. Voiced by Ry?tar? Okiayu.
Marion: A 13-year-old witch from England who flies on a broomstick. She is accompanied by her talking pet rabbit, Pom-Pom, and frequently abuses the poor creature verbally and physically. Marion is fun-loving and thrill-seeking but also selfish, and has a mean streak (which Pom-Pom is often witness to). Voiced by Chiharu Tanaka.
Valnus: A big robot created in Russia six months ago that has some of the best firepower in the game. Secretly wishes to be human. Voiced by Kazuya Tatekabe.
Yuan Nang: A strong-willed and courageous woman whose character design is highly influenced by that of Sun Wukong from the Chinese classical story Journey to the West, including a cloud-somersault parody, Ruyi Jingu Bang, and the size-changing headband that was used by the monk Xuánzàng. Voiced by Naoko Matsui.
Tetsu: A strong, white-haired old man of 60 years. He is homosexual in a rather uncloseted manner and rides in a man-powered helicopter. Voiced by Sakunosuke Maya.
The Trump: A group of sky pirates consist of Ace (voiced by J?ji Yanami), Claude (voiced by Kazuya Tatekabe), and their female leader Rouge (voiced by Noriko Ohara). They are not playable and serve as the players' rivals in the story.</desc>

If one possessed by a shikigami can gather talismans of the five Chinese elements?wood, fire, earth, metal, water?from five demons serving Guwange, then infiltrate Gokumon and slay Guwange, the shikigami will be destroyed and the one possessed will not suffer a premature death.</desc>

		<name>Gyrodine</name>
		<desc>Gyrodine is an arcade game developed by Crux and manufactured by Taito Corporation in 1984. It is a vertically scrolling shooter where the player controls a Gyrodyne aircraft, a type of craft with VTOL (Vertical Take Off and Landing) capabilities. It hovers in the air with helicopter blades, but it contains an addition propulsion system.

In the game, the player must pilot the Gyrodyne over vertically scrolling terrain. The controls contain two button, the player has three weapons at his disposal. One button fires a pair of bullet at enemy aircraft. Another button fires twin machine guns down at the ground. If both buttons are pressed, the Gyrodyne launches a missile with limited heat seeking ability. As a result, the player cannot truly fire both guns at the same time. As the player sweeps to the left or to the right, the guns are angle more and more in those directions until the joystick is released or pushed in the opposite direction.

Gyrodine contains gameplay very similar to Xevious and 1942, but without the same intensity. There are no breaks between levels, and there are long periods where no enemies will attack, only to have them swarm your craft a moment later. The arcade game features especially detailed graphics for its time, drawing tiny people, cars, houses and even beach umbrellas with impressive clarity. The appearance of neutral parties plays a crucial role in your score. Destroying unarmed innocent people will result in a stiff penalty being taken from your score.

Much like Xevious, special icons are hidden and can only be revealed by shooting in the correct location. Revealing the objects yields bonus points. Gyrodine was only ported in Japan by Taito to the MSX home computer and the Famicom. The arcade game was rarely seen outside of Japan, but it could be found in a few arcades in the United States.</desc>

When a stack of five hats of the same type and color is created, it disappears. The challenge of the game is that different styles of hats will stack differently. The game ends when one of your stacks of hats reaches the top of the screen. Occasionally, a red or a blue flame will appear. One burns just the top type of hat on a stack. The other will burn a stack to the ground.</desc>

		<name>Heavy Barrel</name>
		<desc>Heavy Barrel is a 1987 overhead run and gun arcade game by Data East.

Terrorists have seized the underground control complex of a nuclear missile site, and it is up to the player to infiltrate the base and kill the enemy leader. Players begin armed with a laser gun with unlimited ammunition and a limited supply of grenades. Improved weapons and grenade powerups are made available within the game, either in plain sight or within crates that must be unlocked using keys. Additionally, crates may contain orbs or one of the six pieces of the Heavy Barrel superweapon. Like SNK's Ikari Warriors, the original arcade version featured 8-way rotary joysticks.
The name of the game is from an in-game weapon. The Heavy Barrel is found in six pieces and is an energy cannon capable of destroying any enemy in the game with a single shot (except the final enemy, and possibly one other boss that may have required two shots). The weapon has a wide arc of fire and can be fired as fast as the player's trigger finger permits, but after thirty seconds its use is exhausted, at which point the bearer reverts to his previous weaponry. Best used to get past tough bosses, the weapon could be built several times in a single game (probably three or four times). In a two-player game, whoever collects the sixth piece is equipped with the Heavy Barrel.</desc>

You can also check your opponent just like real hockey, only each character has their own bone-crushing way of checking, each with maximum impact and zero tolerance for your well-being.  Players can also start fights with one another to really spice things up.

For an additional credit, players can purchase a 'power drink' that will make them 'Skate Faster and Shoot Harder' at the start of the period for one minute.

Similar to games like Strikers 1945 or Raiden, enemies often attack with extremely fast volleys of projectiles, in contrast to proto-bullet hell games such as DonPachi that started appearing the previous year.
The game has five stages, each ending in a boss fight. Bosses have destructible parts that can be blown apart piece by piece for more points, and each boss also has a telegraphed super weapon that fires periodically and must be avoided.

		<name>Ikari Warriors</name>
		<desc>Ikari Warriors is a vertically-scrolling run 'n' gun shoot-em-up in which one or two players take on the roles of two bandana-wearing musclebound soldiers as they engage in jungle warfare, fighting over land and water to reach the village of Ikari.

Players can rotate their guns through 360 degrees, allowing them to fire and move in all directions. Standing between the soldiers and their destination is a multitude of enemy soldiers, tanks, helicopters and reinforced bunkers. 

The enemy soldiers utilise a number of different weapons, including machine-guns, grenades, super grenades and flame-throwers. The game's standard enemy troops wear blue uniforms, but there are also enemies in red uniforms that when killed, often drop power-ups that either give players more ammunition, increase the power of bullets and grenades or even kill all enemies on the screen. The players' munitions are limited in number so additional ammo and grenades must to be picked up along the way. 

While most of the action takes place on foot, unoccupied enemy tanks can be found that can be entered and driven. Tanks offer increased firepower as well as resistance to enemy shots. Too many enemy hits, however, will eventually see the tank explode, this is proceeded by a warning flash to allow the player to exit the tank before the explosion. Should the player be caught inside when the tank explodes, a life is lost. Tanks also have a limited amount of fuel but extra fuel can be found to replenish it.

Another obstacle that players need to be wary of, whether on foot or in a tank, are hidden land-mines. These cannot initially be seen put will appear and flash as the player approaches. These cannot be destroyed and contact with them results in an instant death.

Unlike most arcade games, Ikari Warriors is not separated into different stages; the game takes place over one huge, scrolling stage. Ikari Warriors does have a continue feature, but it's only possible to continue from where the last game ended by first holding down the FIRE button, then pressing the start button. Simply pressing the start button restarts the game from the very beginning.</desc>

		<desc>Image Fight is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up with an original premise. The game's first five stages are supposed to be a 'simulation' and serve as training to test the player's abilities. Player's will receive a penalty if their hit-ratio is too low.

Once players have proved themselves on the opening stages, they will progress to the game's last three stages, blasting off into space on a mission to destroy the alien vegetation surrounding the Moon's main computer. If the player fails in the mission, they must endure the dreaded 'Penalty Zone'. Features a high level of challenge, a wide variety of weapons and the ability to change speed.

If the player's ship is equipped with one or more red/blue extra guns, pushing both Action buttons simultaneously will sling the guns forward in a boomerang-like fashion. This is a powerful and destructive method and can be done an unlimited number of times.</desc>

Indy must infiltrate the lair of the evil Thuggee cult and their boss, Mola Ram, armed only with his trademark whip. The goal is to free the children the cult has kidnapped as slaves, recover the stolen relics known as "Sankara Stones" and escape from the temple.

The game that takes place over three different zones; the mines, a mine-cart chase and the temple. Players can choose to start the game on any one of three difficulty levels: easy, medium and hard. These are selected by entering the corresponding door.

The first zone is made up of ledges, ladders, slides and conveyor belts. Indy must free kidnapped children by finding their cages and whipping them open. Rattlesnakes and Thuggee guards patrol the ledges and must be avoided or whipped. Players must be careful to not fall from a ledge or a life is lost. Mola Ram himself occasionally appears and throws flaming hearts at Indy, these must be whipped or avoided.
The second zone is a recreation of the famous mine cart chase from the movie and the player must guide Indy's cart to the bottom of the mine, keeping ahead of enemy carts and avoiding dead ends and track-side enemies. The cart can be steered left and right to different tracks to avoid obstacles.
The third zone takes place in the temple itself and Indy must make his way to the altar and retrieve the Sankara stone. Indy must avoid guards, rattlesnakes and flaming hearts thrown by Mola Ram. Once a Sankara stone has been retrieved Indy must escape the temple through one of the four doors that opens.

The zones are then repeated twice more to collect the two remaining stones, although the lay-out and difficulty of the zones is different. Once all three Sankara stones have been collected, Indy must work his way through a final mine and mine-cart section, before making his escape on a rope bridge and facing Mola Ram for the final time.

		<name>J. J. Squawkers</name>
		<desc>J.J. Squawkers is a scrolling run 'n' gun platform shoot-em-up for one or two players in which several residents from the peaceful village of Pistachio have been kidnapped. Most of the remaining villagers have fallen under a mysterious spell, making them violent. Players take on the roles of two ducks called 'Ani Karasukun' and 'Ototo Karasukun' who set out to defeat the enemy minions and restore peace to their village. 

The ducks can fire projectiles to defeat the abstract enemies they face, with their default weapon being tomatoes. Other weapons - as well as bonus and health power-ups - become available when certain enemies are killed. Available weapons include pumpkins, watermelon seeds, screws and slinkys wearing red sneakers. 

Each weapon has different strengths and weaknesses; for example the slinkys simply walk in a straight line until they either meet obstacles or the edge of screen, making it easy to deal with enemies from a distance. On the other hand, watermelon seeds can only be thrown a short distance but several are thrown at once. This effectively gives players a 'spread shot' and is more effective when multiple enemies are attacking from several directions at once. 

J.J. Squawkers consists of five stages with a powerful end-of-level guardian waiting at the end of each.</desc>

ON THE SCREEN: The game is made up of groups of 5 sequences for each rack. When play begins, all the performers run onto the screen and jump aboard their transport ship, the Scarab. The Scarab then lifts off and heads for a point in space that is at the center of a grouping of five planets. (The song that is played in the background during this scene is 'Lights'.) Each group member's instrument is on a different planet.

At the beginning of each sequence, when a 2-PLAYER game has been selected, the game tells which player is up.

		<name>Joust</name>
		<desc>Joust is a platform-based action combat game for one or two-players (with the two-player game offering either team-up OR head-to-head combat; the first time arcade gamers were given this choice) in which each player controls a knight riding on the back of a flying ostrich. 

The object of the game is to progress through platform-based levels by defeating groups of buzzard-riding enemy knights. This is achieved by 'jousting'; both enemy and player knights carry a lance and must fly around the level (actioned by repeatedly hitting the 'Flap' button) trying to oust rival knights from their steeds by ramming them with the lance. This can only be achieved if the attacking rider is above the enemy knight when the lance connects. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other, but if a player is lower than their enemy at the instant of contact, they themselves will be knocked from their steed and lose a life. 

A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls to the bottom of the screen. This must be quickly collected by players as if the egg lands on a platform and isn't retrieved in time, it will eventually hatch into another enemy knight that must be defeated again. 

Joust features three different types of enemy knights - Bounder, Hunter, and Shadow Lord - with each earning players different points values when defeated. A pterodactyl will appear after a predetermined time to hunt the players. 

Accurately navigating the player Knights can be initially quite difficult as control is strongly affected by both gravity and inertia. Players can lose a life by either being knocked from their steed by an enemy knight, or by falling into the lava pit at the bottom of each level.</desc>

On the planet of the floating cliffs, society calls upon its wing-mounted Gladiators to solve conflicts. You, the Gladiator, must enter the fray, participating in a challenge of honor, a Joust... where only the fittest survive! 

The legend of "Joust" continues in Joust 2. Players must solve the puzzle of what strategy will be most effective in dealing with the buzzards and other winged enemies on each of Joust 2's 35 different backgrounds. 

The object of Joust 2 is to defeat all winged enemies by colliding with them. To survive a collision (joust), the Gladiator's lance must be higher.

		<desc>Kaiser Knuckle follows the same fighting game conventions established by Street Fighter II. The player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. The player has a character roster of nine fighters to choose from, and three bosses, each with their own unique fighting style and special techniques. The control layout is set to the six-button standard (a la most Capcom fighting games), but it can be switched to a five-button layout via dip settings. One unique feature is that Kaiser Knuckle was the first and only fighting game that has five strengths of basic attacks.

Another unique feature is that it introduced the power zones, which can be utilized via a successful hit of a special move when a player's "Crush Meter" is full. The power zones (either fire or electric) can affect the certain special move a character has. Backgrounds can be destructible when players get hit to charge up, and when those meters are full, the next special move that a player connects with his/her opponent will destroy the background's properties at will (other parts of stages, such as floors and walls are also destructible).</desc>

While in no way original (drawing most of its inspiration from Capcom's "Final Fight"), Karate Blazers is both hugely playable and very fast and frenetic, with the amount of on-screen enemies at times overwhelming. The graphics are also well drawn and nicely animated.</desc>

To further make your travels a hazard, different enemies attempt to end Karnov's life prematurely and prevent him from getting to the treasure. To aid Karnov in his adventures, he has certain items that he can draw from his inventory. In addition, there are other items that can make Karnov a potent foe of those wishing to harm him.

The continuous industrialization that started in 1900, finally led to unavoidable consequences in the middle of the 21st century. The waterlevel rose worldwide and threatened many coastal countries. So the shorelines had to be modified In order to save the human civilisation from drowning. It was a time of great confusion about the future, and nobody thought about war. Well, almost ... There was one company called EVAC corporation, who made a great profit from underhand productions and exports of weapon systems. When the United Nations discovered their illegal trades, they pointed EVAC to the global ban of weapon imports and exports, and asked them to stop their productions and to destroy their weapon facilities immediately. EVAC rejected all accusations and refused to take any actions. So a preventive war was started by the United Nations to stop the EVAC corporation.</desc>

		<desc>In Lightning Fighters and Trigon, the original Japanese version, there are different rules depending on whether you start the game with one or two players. In a one-player game, you start with no bombs, and when you die the game restarts you at a checkpoint. In a two-player game, each life starts with one bomb, and when you die you respawn in place. There are some powerups that only appear in a two-player game and one that only appears in a one-player game. The game type cannot be changed once the game starts. A second player cannot join an originally one-player game; conversely, if one player dies in a two-player game the game remains in two-player mode and the second player can rejoin at any time.

In Lightning Fighters, even if you start a one-player game, the game is always in two-player mode: you respawn in place when you die and you start each life with one bomb stocked. This means that a second player can join midway into a one-player game. Unfortunately it also means that the powerup that only appears in one-player games in the other versions, does not appear at all in the US version.</desc>

Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.</desc>

You then either must release your lander or after a pre-determined period of time, the mother ship will forcibly eject it. You first have to navigate through six rows of asteroids to make it to one of the landing platforms. You have six platforms initially but each landing will eliminate one since there is one platform per astronaut you have to rescue. On your return trip up, the screen changes and now you have saucers trying to destroy you with laser fire. Again, you will either have three or six rows of saucers depending if there are meteors in the area. You then must successfully land in the docking bay of the mother ship to get credit for a successful rescue of one astronaut.</desc>

		<name>Magic Sword: Heroic Fantasy</name>
		<desc>Magic Sword: Heroic Fantasy is a side-scrolling fantasy arcade game released by Capcom in 1990. The player can use a sword, an axe, or magic, and can also rescue and recruit potential allies from different character classes, each with their own special abilities. Three years earlier, Capcom had released the similar Black Tiger in 1987.

Magic Sword is set in a nameless world threatened by the dark lord Drokmar, who is in control of an evil crystal known as the "Black Orb" that would allow him to rule the world. To prevent this from happening, the Brave Hero must climb to the top of the 50-story tower that Drokmar resides in, known as the Dragon Keep. After Drokmar is defeated, the player has the option of two endings: destroy the Black Orb, or take control of it and become the new Dark Lord.</desc>

		<desc>In Magical Drop II, you control a clown that can grab and throw balloons. You have to match three balloons of the same colour or more vertically to pop them and clear the screen. You can hold multiple balloons of the same colour at once and cause consecutive collisions. There are special balloons that cannot be removed that easily and power-ups that clear entire rows or provide additional help.

Depending of the originating country, there are different game modes:

1. Survival: Play as long as you can - an endless flow of balloons appears at a rapidly increasing speed while you move up levels.

2. Puzzle: You have a limited time to clear a fixed set of balloons before time runs out.

3. VS Mode: Fight the CPU or a fellow player in a direct split-screen duel. Each character has specific item balloons during gameplay.</desc>

In the game you control a clown who throws marbles up on the screen into the cluster of multi-colored marbles, rocks and crystals. The goal is to get three or more of the same color to remove marbles, but you can also grab more than one at the time to create long chain combos and gain better "special" blocks at the top of the screen.

You can play the game in single player modes or versus a friend in versus mode. In versus mode you get to pick your character, much like in a fighting game, each with their own counter attacks and abilities.

For the PSX version, the first Magical Drop was included on a separate disc.</desc>

		<name>Major Title 2</name>
		<desc>Major Title 2 is a golf game for up to four players who choose to play as one of four different golfers. Each golfer possesses a unique skill-set that influences their ability to make certain types of shots (power hitter, all-round player, technician and magician). 

The game offers a choice of two different courses and provides the usual array of game modes: tournament, match play, stroke play and a skins game.

During play, the action is presented in two different perspectives. The pre-shot perspective is a standard third-person view from behind the golfer but once the ball is hit, the view switches to a top-down perspective to track the ball in flight. Once players are on the green, a window is displayed showing a zoomed-in overhead view detailing the green's contours. 

Major Title 2 takes a simplified approach to hitting the ball. Instead of setting the power and controlling the shot, the only function of the swing meter is to select the vertical angle of the shot, which sets the amount of back or topspin applied to the ball. The strength of each swing is selected prior to the shot by setting a power gauge to one of 16 levels. 

Draw and fade can also be applied to the ball by changing the players stance prior to taking the shot. However, the game specifies the maximum distance for the putter in yards, but measures distance on the greens in meters.</desc>

The game's goal is to guide a small glass marble over a three-dimensional maze and reach the finish line before the level's timer has expired. Any seconds that remain on the timer when the finish line is crossed are carried over to the next level. 

As well as having to negotiate the marble over treacherous walkways and ramps, numerous obstacles and unfriendly creatures will try to slow the marble's progress or knock it over the edge of a platform, wasting yet more precious seconds until a replacement marble appears. The two-player game has players competing to reach the goal first.

In 2100, millions of people were starving due to massive food shortages and has caused civil wars around the world. Centuries later, however, the world government had sent colonists to Mars which began to solve these problems. At a nearby farm, the Infinity chip was discovered and it revealed all the technology of the advanced civilization. In 2309, a Declaration of Independence has been sent to Earth. Large armies have been amassed on Mars, and a gigantic armada was waiting for any attack from Earth. The Earth government sends out a fleet of battleships followed by a special air raid unit called ACID; ACID is equipped with a new fighter ship known as the Mosquito. Their mission is to enter Mars, stop the rebel violence, locate and destroy the rebel leader, whoever... or whatever it may be...</desc>

		<desc>Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is the fourth Marvel Comics-licensed fighting game produced by Capcom and the second installment in the Marvel vs. Capcom series. It is a sequel to X-Men vs. Street Fighter which replaces most of the X-Men characters with characters from Marvel Super Heroes. In an attempt to balance the previous game's problems, the game engine was altered, although it remained aesthetically the same which is what the game was criticized for. The game was released for the arcade in 1997

Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter features a roster of 17 playable fighters, with nine characters from the Street Fighter universe and eight heroes from the Marvel Universe, It utilizes the same one-on-one tag team format previously employed in X-Men vs. Street Fighter. 
The player chooses a team of two fighters, each sporting their own life gauge; at the start of the match, the first selected character is controlled by the player, while the second character remains off-screen and acts as support.

		<desc>Earth is under attack from an alien race from the 'Nemesis' region of space, and human civilisation now stands on the brink of collapse. The invaders have utilised energy molecules - known to earth scientists as 'Newalones' - to create powerful beam weapons with which to attack Earth. In response, Earth's scientists have developed the 'Black Fly' project; a powerful space craft that utilises the same Newalone molecule technology of the alien aggressors.

Metal Black is a very playable sideways scrolling shoot-em-up which manages to feel different to other games in the genre, due to the fact that it lacks a a player-definable weapon power-up system. Instead of collecting items that provide extra speed, different weapons etc. players must collect the clusters of 'Newalone' molecules that float around each level. These molecule clusters will gradually increase the player ship's firepower.</desc>

		<desc>In the third installment of the Metal Slug series, General Morden is back and he plans to establish a new world order. You guide one of the heroes: Marco, Tarma, Eri or Fio as they blast their way through sidescrolling levels with a unique theme, filled with countless enemies and difficult bosses. You have to free hostages and you can ride bizarre vehicles such as camels, elephants, tanks and robots.

In the Xbox version, additional game modes, such as Storming the Mothership and Chubby Isle Paradiso, can be unlocked upon completing the five arcade stages. A co-op mode has been included, but no online multiplayer. The only Xbox Live feature available allows you to compare singleplayer scores.</desc>

		<name>Metro-cross</name>
		<desc>Metro-Cross is an abstract, horizontally-scrolling single player racing game set in an automated futuristic city. Players take on the role of 'The Runner', who must run through each of the game's 32 stages to cross the finish line before the time limit expires. If the Runner finishes a round within the time limit, remaining time is converted to bonus points and the next round begins. 

Obstacles that hinder the runner's progress include 'Slip Zones' that slow him down if he tries to run over them, 'Pitfalls' that  break under the Runner's weight and drop him into the holes and 'Crackers' that launch the Runner up into the air and cause him to land on his back. Later rounds also feature 'Jumbo Tires' that bounce towards the Runner, barriers that emerge from the ground before receding back into it, Cubes that move through particular columns of tiles, Mice that attempt to jump onto the Runner and slow him down and Chess Knights and Kings that bounce from one tile to another. Clinging mice fall off the runner if he leaps from a springboard.

Progress is aided by yellow springboards that hurl the runner forwards at great speed (players must press the fire button while on the springboard) and a skateboard, that is unaffected by the green 'Slip Zone' tiles that would otherwise slow the player's progress. Bonus points can be earned by kicking the static drinks cans that can be found throughout each level.

Every fourth round is special, using the remaining time from the three previous rounds as additional completion time. However, if the Runner has not finished the round before the time limit runs out, he will be electrocuted and the game is immediately over.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, Moonwalker is a scrolling, isometric beat' em up in which Michael Jackson (1958-2009), along with his chimp Bubbles, attempts to save children and defeat the evil 'Mr. Big'. During each round, the player must defeat each and every one of Mr. Big's henchmen and the deadly enemy machines that patrol the levels. This is achieved either by shooting them with Michael Jackson's 'magical energy', or by using his Dance Magic - the game's equivalent of a smart bomb. Some enemies take only one shot to defeat whereas others take several shots before they are destroyed. The longer the player holds down on the fire button, the greater the amount of magical energy Michael can inflict. At the start of each round, the player is given 2 dance magic smart bombs. Towards the end of each round, Michael's pet chimpanzee, Bubbles, will be seen moving about. If Michael touches Bubbles, he will turn into a powerful robot (the 'Moonwalker' of the game's title). After Michael has become Moonwalker, he will be able to shoot lasers and fire missiles. Michael must defeat every boss enemy at the end of each round in order to proceed to the next.</desc>

		<desc>"Midnight Resistance" is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up for one or two players, taking on the role of two commando brothers whose entire family has been kidnapped and must be rescued. The game consists of nine large, eight-way scrolling levels made up of platforms, ledges and ladders. Each is populated with enemy soldiers and gun emplacements, as well as occasional armoured vehicles. At the end of each stage players must defeat a large, powerful enemy boss. 

Players can rotate their guns through 360 degrees, allowing them to fire in all directions. Some enemies, when killed, will drop a red key; collecting these keys allows players to upgrade their weapons at the shop that awaits at the end of each level. A maximum of six keys can be carried at any one time and when the player loses a life, all weapons and keys in their possession are dropped. These can be recovered at the start of the next life providing they haven't fallen off-screen. 

In addition to main weapon upgrades, secondary weapons can also be bought. These appear as backpacks attached to the player characters and fire when the player pushes up on the joystick while firing their main weapon. Both the main and secondary weapons have only a limited amount of ammo but more can be bought from the end-of-level shops.

		<name>Millipede</name>
		<desc>
Millipede is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan video display. The game action takes place on a playfield filled with mushrooms, flowers, and deadly DDT bombs. The player tries to destroy a variety of insects that drop from the top of the screen or enter from the sides of the screen, most of them to attack the player. The player controls a bow-shaped vehicle called the Archer. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy as many objects as possible for a high point score, before the player's lives are all used up.

Player control consists of a Midi Trak-Ball control and a FIRE button. The Archer is moved by rotating the Midi Trak-Ball control. The Archer can be moved in all directions, but only within the bottom fifth of the screen. However, the Archer must move around mushrooms, flowers, and DDT bombs, since these are fixed and not 'transparent' objects. Pressing the FIRE button causes the Archer to emit an arrow that travels upward. The Archer may fire one or many arrows (by holding down the FIRE button constantly). But only one arrow will appear on the screen at a time.

		<desc>The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Future Ninja - Stealth Joy Cloud Device Side Story'.

Mirai Ninja was based on a Japanese movie of the same name, also produced by Namco. Both the game and the movie were released the same year.
The plot of the movie: A man's body and soul are stolen and used as part of a demon castle. What's left becomes Cyber Ninja. He teams up with the chi students whose cyber-earmuffs show matching red symbols. They fill their swords with ammunition, grab some neo-retro-cyber-antique guns and attack the demon robot expendable ninja squad. Each fight is won by whichever side uses more gratuitous special effects. They slay the Tron-like hover droids, who are destroyed in their shame. There's a showdown with a white-armored guy with dreadlocks, who is later reincarnated by the eclipse and a lot of multicolored lightning. After killing the make-up wearing effeminate spider person, the chi school fires a giant gun at the demon castle spider cyber robot. It blows up.</desc>

		<desc>Moon Cresta is a single screen shoot-em-up with the player controlling an armed ship that moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen and must use their ship to destroy waves of attacking aliens. 

The player begins the game with a small ship armed with a single laser cannon. Upon successful completion of the first four waves of alien attacks, the player's ship will be able to dock with the next 'stage' of fighter ship, although the docking procedure must be completed within a set time. This larger, two-stage ship has increased fire power (three lasers).

After successfully clearing a further two alien waves and surviving a meteor shower, the two-stage ship will be able to dock with the third and final piece, giving the player the largest and most powerful ship, which is now armed with five lasers. Bonus points are awarded depending on how quickly the docking procedures are completed.

If the multi-stage ship is hit, the player continues with whatever stages remain. If players achieve a score of 30,000, they are awarded a free game and their score continues to accumulate.

Upon completion of the first eight screens, the player's ship will revert back to its small, single-stage incarnation and the game begins again with an increased level of difficulty.</desc>

		<desc>Moon Patrol is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player takes the role of a Luna City police officer assigned to Sector Nine, home of the toughest thugs in the galaxy. 

The player controls a moon buggy that travels over the moon's surface, trying to avoid or destroy any obstacles in its path, including craters, rocks and mines. UFOs attack the buggy from above by dropping bombs, some UFO bombs will create a new crater when they hit the ground, generating a new obstacle to avoid.

The buggy can jump to avoid craters, mines and rocks, it also has both front and vertically-mounted cannons that fire missiles simultaneously. The vertical cannon is to destroy UFOs while the front-cannon can take out obstacles that lie in the buggy's path.

Moon Patrol has five different stages spread over 26 check-points, each designated a letter of the English alphabet. The five checkpoints that denote a new stage are E, J, O, T and Z and each new stage sees a change in background graphics as well as an increase in difficulty. One example of this is the introduction of landmines in the third stage (stage 'J').

A status panel is displayed at the top of the screen that gives the player useful information. A progress bar showing the five major checkpoints and the player's current position is displayed at the bottom of the panel. Above the progress bar is an indicator of the current checkpoint, the time spent in the stage and three indicator lights: the top light indicates upcoming enemy aerial attacks, the middle one indicates an upcoming minefield and the bottom one indicates enemies approaching from behind.

At the end of each stage bonus points are awarded based on how quickly the stage was completed.

		<desc>Mortal Kombat, first in the Mortal Kombat series, is a 1-on-1 fighting game featuring a cast of seven different characters. Mortal Kombat took ideas from Capcom's seminal Street Fighter II, such as the game's special moves and projectiles. It also introduced a cast of photo-realistic digitized fighters for players to fight either as or against. 

Mortal Kombat characters list:
JOHNNY CAGE
KANO
RAIDEN
LIU KANG
SCORPION
SUB-ZERO
SONYA BLADE

Battles are fought over the best of three rounds. At the end of a battle, a voice instructs the winner to 'Finish Him/Her!' and players have only a couple of seconds to try and execute their character's 'fatality', which sees the winner killing the loser in a spectacular and grisly fashion.</desc>

Motos can be outfitted with no more than seven power parts; the more power parts added, the more powerful Motos is. However, Motos can only be outfitted with only one jump part per round. With a jump part, Motos can jump over two squares by moving the joystick in the desired direction and pressing the Jump button. One jump on a square cracks the square and a second jump in the same spot makes a hole in the solar base.

You can outfit Motos with these parts in the Power Parts or Jump Parts screen displayed at the beginning of each round. Select the number of parts you want by moving left and right with the joystick, and lock them in place by pressing the Jump button. You can use the selected parts for one round only; they will not be available in subsequent rounds.

Linger too long on the playing field and Shooting Stars will begin to fall periodically onto the solar base. The Stars are aimed at Motos, and when they miss they crack a square or break a hole in the solar base (like they do to the base behind the Motos logo in the attract mode's title sequence).

		<name>Mr. Do's Castle</name>
		<desc>The player controls a clown, named “Mr. Do!”. Mr. Do is in his garden, and wants to collect the cherries there. Monsters roam there, and will not let Mr. Do quietly collect. If a monster touches Mr. Do, it dies, and the player loses a life. At each level a path is dug through the garden, going from the bottom to the top of the screen, passing through the center. Monsters can only take paths that have already been dug. Mr. Do is able to dig new paths, at the cost of slower movement speed.</desc>

		<name>Mr. Do's Wild Ride</name>
		<desc>Mr Do's third arcade outing is another platform game, following on from the superb "Mr. Do's Castle", released a year earlier. The synonymous Mr. Do! cherries are present and correct, but are not used in the same way as in other games in the series. In both "Mr Do!" and "Mr. Do's Castle", collecting all of the cherries available was a way of completing a level. In Wild Ride, however, collecting them merely changes the 'prize' awarded upon reaching the level's goal. This can be one or two letters from EXTRA, or other items which simply award bonus points. When Mr. Do reaches his goal, he waves a flag while the bonus counter is added to his score.

The gameplay is similar to that of Nintendo's legendary "Donkey Kong", with Mr. Do starting each level at the bottom of the screen, trying to make his way to the exit at the very top. Mr. Do doesn't have either his Powerball or mallet in this game, but holding the ACTION button makes him run faster along the track. The trade-off of this is that his bonus points deplete much quicker. When all of the EXTRA letters are collected, the player is awarded with an extra life.

Each of the game's six levels is set on a roller coaster, with each having its own theme, traps and pitfalls. Wild Ride doesn't feature the intermission screens that appear in previous Mr.Do games.

The levels are:
Level 1, Roller Coaster. 
Level 2, Pirate Ship. 
Level 3, Three Elevators. 
Level 4, Castle on Screen. 
Level 5, Multiple Columns. 
Level 6, Six Rings.

After level six the levels are repeated.</desc>

		<desc>In this, the first proper sequel to Namco's legendary pill eating maze game, players must once again run around a number of mazes, eating all of the pills that are scattered throughout. The ever-present ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Sue) return to hamper the player's progress. The infamous 'Power Pills' are also present and correct, with four appearing in each maze. 

Namco introduced a number of changes and enhancements over the original game. The first difference is in the main character. For the first time in video-game history, the game's lead character was female. Ms. Pac-Man is almost identical to the original character with two main differences; she wears a bow in her 'hair', and is also wearing lipstick. 

Another change from the original is that the bonus fruit items are no longer static but now move randomly around the mazes. 

Ms Pac-Man features four different maze layouts, which alternate every two to four rounds:

In order to resolve this conflict, 8 organizations combined to form the Capcom Professional Wrestling Association (CPWA), led by Victor Ortega, the CPWA?s first champion.

One day, Ortega suddenly vanished. He was considered to be the axis of the sport and his unexpected disappearance caused the CPWA to enter an age of confusion and disorder. The BPWA, a dark underground wrestling organization, chose to take advantage of this opportunity and began moving. With "Fighters of Muscle Bomber = Destiny" as the theme, the CPWA chief executives decided to hold a world tour called the ?Crash Carnival,? to decide the new king of the CPWA.

The gong that determines the new ?Master of Muscle Bomber? is sounded?</desc>

Mystic Warriors features five selectable characters, one of which is shown being kidnapped by SKULL once players have made their character choices. What follows is eight levels of platform 'run-and-gun' action, with an end-of-level boss waiting at the end of each stage.

Players are armed with both Shuriken throwing stars and with a sword for close encounters. Numerous boxes are scattered throughout the levels (or are being carried by enemies), all of which contain bonus items such as weapon power-ups or energy-replenishing food. Other power-ups include an invulnerability shield (known as the "Shinobi Shield") which lasts a few seconds and a "Smart Bomb" power-up, which destroys all on-screen enemies. Some boxes also contain points-giving items, such as bags of money, jewellery and gold.</desc>

There are several differently colored woodpeckers that hatch from the large eggs positioned on the left and right sides of the screen, which set out to stop him. The player has a single button with which to make Naughty Mouse jump over them.

Some of the ladders may also become electrified after Naughty Mouse has climbed them, forbidding him to go back down them again on pain of death. Once he has reached his girlfriend's house, he will receive the stage's remaining time as bonus points and proceed to the next stage.

The main difference between Naughty Mouse and Woodpecker is the color palettes, and stage arrangements.</desc>

		<desc>NebulasRay is a vertically scrolling shoot'em up for one or two players. Civil war has broken out in the Austral star system, with the militaristic 'Master Forces' ousting the ruling government and looking to seize control of the entire system. 

Taking on the role of resistance fighters, players must battle through waves of enemy ships across 6 levels, before finally reaching and destroying the 'Master Fortress'. As well as forward-firing weapons, each player ship also carries a limited number of powerful bombs that inflict much greater damage on the enemy than the standard weapons. Initially, each player ship is armed with only 3 bombs. 

Numerous weapons and power-ups can be picked up during play, each of which can itself be powered-up: 
WIDE SHOT - Increases shot width. 5 levels available. 
GAIN POWER - Increases destructive power. 5 levels available. 
SPEED UP - Increases player ship speed. 5 levels available. 
BOMB - Extra bomb. Maximum of 7 can be carried. 
FOUR-BARREL PHOTON - Powerful Photon torpedoes. Time-based. 
HOMING LASER - Powerful lasers that automatically target enemies. Time-based. 
LIGHTING BURST - Powerful short-range lightning burst. Time-based. 
DEFLECTOR - Shield to protect player ships. Time-based. 
EXTRA POINTS - Pick up for 3000 points. 

Visually, NebulasRay employs complex sprite rotation and scaling techniques - as well as multi-layered parallax scrolling - to create impressive and highly detailed graphics with a true sense of depth.</desc>

The game features a power-up system based on a selection meter at the bottom of the screen called a 'power meter', this allows players to 'buy' weapons and upgrades. To achieve this, players must destroy special individual enemies - usually red in colour - or enemy waves that then drop orange capsules. These capsules can be collected and used to upgrade the Viper's weapons. Each collected capsule advances the power meter by one step. Players can activate the highlighted item at any point, after which the power meter resets.</desc>

		<name>Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge</name>
		<desc>Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge is the second game in the Darkstalkers series of gothic horror fighting games. Released in 1995, it is the upgraded version of the original game which introduced several gameplay changes to the game.

The game introduced two new playable characters, Donovan Baine and Hsien-Ko, who were out to hunt the other Darkstalkers (hence the Japanese title, Vampire Hunter). The two bosses from the first game, Huitzil and Pyron, were now playable characters as well. The game was first released for arcades and later ported to the Sega Saturn. Character art was done by Ikeno.</desc>

		<name>Nightmare in the Dark</name>
		<desc>This was an ancient story when people still believed in witchcraft.

There lived one gravedigger at a very small village in a remote region. He lived a quiet, solitary life in a corner of the cemetery. He kept away from the village people due to his very ugly appearance. One day, he found the graves were ransacked and some corpses were stolen. He didn't want the village people to find out, so he decided to eliminate the grave burglars by himself. Thus, he patrolled the cemetery every night.

There are five stages with five levels each, and each one of them has you throwing fireballs at ghouls, ghosts, goblins, and zombies. When you keep throwing fireballs at these enemies, they will ignite into a giant fireball, which you can throw at other enemies to kill them, and get the remaining treasure before moving on to the next level. At the end of the fifth level, a boss must be defeated in order to continue the game.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Baseball Bat Man</name>
		<desc>Ninja Baseball Batman is an abstract, horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for in which up to four players control a team of robotic baseball-star ninjas who must fight their way through a variety of levels, defeating the game's many enemies. 

The object of the game is to recover a number of artifacts stolen from the Baseball Hall of Fame, a task prescribed to them by the Commissioner of Baseball. Each stage takes place in several parts of the United States, with a boss character appears at the end of each stage.

The game's enemies are themed entirely around the sport of Baseball; taking the form of Baseballs, Catcher's mitts, bats etc. The game also allows players to perform combos, throws and dash attacks against multiple enemies. When a player's health bar flashes red, more moves can be performed as long as the player does not restore or completely lose health. 

Health restoring food and drink items appear throughout the game, as well as throwable weapon pick-ups, including baseballs and shuriken. Occasionally players will find a pink heart, collecting this summons cheerleaders who either damage all on-screen enemies or drop a large amount of food.

The four characters of "Ninja Baseball Batman" and their traits are:

Captain Jose - Head of the team and technician. Well-balanced and a good choice for beginners. 
    
Twinbats Ryno - Very fast and wields two bats, but is the weakest of the four.
    
Beanball Roger - He is a powerful buster, but not as fast as others. 
    
Stick Straw - A long-reach hitter, making him the best choice for long-range moves.</desc>

		<name>Numan Athletics</name>
		<desc>An athletics game featuring 8 tournaments:

Interceptor
A real life missile defense style-contest as missiles are being launched from a ship, and you must use your mystical powers to stop the oncoming missiles. The outside buttons (1 &amp; 3) make you step to the left or right, and the middle button is fire. Failure to hit the missile results in you being blown up. If you select Sharon from France, most of her clothes would disappear except for the bottom part of her suit.

Niagara Jumps
The final competition in the tournament. It is also considered to be the most difficult competition in the game. Very similar to the Triple Jump competition in the Olympics. The object is this contest is to make it across the falls. Alternately press buttons 1 and 3 to build up speed, then press button 2 three times. If you don't time yourself properly, you will sink and drown and you will go down the steep falls.

Nonstop Rock Chop
You must smash as many rocks as you can before time runs out. Rapidly press buttons 1 and 3 alternately until the gauge is full, then press button 2 to smash the rock.

Numan Sniper
In this contest, monsters will jump out of the sea from three different locations. Your object, destroy them. Press buttons 1, 2 or 3 varying by their location to shoot.

Scud Toss
Just as in the Javelin competition in the Olympics. Played on a "Track and Field"-like field with an only exception -- a missile. Rapidly and continuously press the two run buttons and then push and hold the middle button to set the angle of which you would throw the missile. Again, like Interceptor, if you select Sharon -- then again if she is faulted, she will be missing most of her clothes.

Tower Topper
Here you are expected to climb up to the building rooftop with the fastest time possible. Press button 2 repeatedly to scale the side of a building. If you press it too early -- you won't move, but if you press it too late -- you will fall off.

Turbo Dash
Much like the 100m Dash in the Olympics -- only the core elements have slightly changed. You are racing against a drag racer and another player. Press the two outside buttons (1 &amp; 3) in alternate fashion until your RSI (or 'special speed') sets in.

VS. Express
Very similar to a familiar scene in the Superman comic books. You must stop the oncoming train using your magical powers and send it in the opposite direction backwards. Press button 2 to stop the train, then hammer the outside buttons to build up power before bunging it back down the track. If you don't time this right -- the train will run you over.</desc>

		<desc>Osman is a side-scrolling action platforming game produced by Mitchell Corp. that was released exclusively to arcades in 1996. Many ex-Capcom staff including Kouichi Yotsui (credited as Isuke), worked on the original arcade version of Strider and designed Osman as an unofficial sequel to Strider. Yotsui directed both titles.

In contrast to Strider's futuristic Kazakh-Soviet setting, Osman is set in a neon-lit cyberpunk Arabian setting, while Strider Hiryu is replaced by a Middle Eastern protagonist named Kirin who fights without any weapons.The game's bizarre plot supposedly mocks director Kouichi Yotsui's experience at Capcom after Strider.

The Ozma wars has begun, and the player controls a spacecraft which must fend off UFOs, spaceships meteors, and comets in a varied of space levels. Instead of lives, the player is given an energy reserve that is constantly diminishing; getting hit by the enemy causes gameplay to stop momentarily and a large amount of energy is depleted. Every so often, a mothership will appear and dock with the player's spacecraft, allowing the energy to be refilled. There are 3-4 recognizable stages as the game progresses and new enemies begin to appear. After these, the mothership will appear, and the cycle starts over; this continues indefinitely until the energy reaches zero.</desc>

		<desc>P-47 is a two-dimensional, scrolling shooter type of game. You play as the pilot of a P-47. Your mission is to basically destroy as many of the enemies as you possibly can. This means eliminating as many air and ground units as you can. You will be going through four missions (each being broken up into two parts) and at the end of each of these parts is an enemy boss for you to tangle with. Although you have unlimited ammunition, the enemy will make you pay for the invasion into their homeland. You will be able to accomplish this with various power-ups and also a second player (if they buy in). Your mission won't be easy but it is necessary so you can secure both the skies and ground for our troops.

The game is broken up into four missions. Within these four missions, there are 2 parts. One part involves going over land and the other part has you either going over water or being up in the air. Regardless of which part you are on, you will still have to deal with the same basic things. After part two of mission four, the missions will repeat again with mission one.</desc>

		<desc>Prisoners of War is a horizontally-scrolling run 'n' gun platform game for one or two players in which Special Forces soldiers escape from a POW camp and must fight their way through enemy territory to reach the extraction point and rescue. 

The escaping POWs fight primarily using hand-to-hand combat, but limited-use knives and sub-machine guns can be retrieved from fallen enemy soldiers. The game consists of three action buttons for punching, kicking and jumping. There are also three special attacks performed by pressing two buttons simultaneously: a jump kick (jump, then kick), a back punch (jump and punch simultaneously) and a headbutt (punch and kick simultaneously).

The controls change when wielding a weapon; the knife is thrown by pressing the punch button, but can preserved by using kicks. When wielding the machine gun, players can fire it by pressing the kick button, or can conserve its ammo by pressing the punch button to gun-whip enemies from close-range.</desc>

		<desc>Peter Pack Rat is a platform game in which the player, controlling the game's hero, a rat called Peter; must rush around a platform-filled screen collecting a variety of objects to take back to Peter's nest. These objects include bottles, watches, hats, balls, and cans.

A number of enemy creatures hinder the player's progress; these include rats, cats, dogs, bats and owls. There are 3 different levels to play through; a junkyard, a sewer and a tree.

As well as the objects that must be collected and taken to Peter's nest, additional objects can also be collected and thrown to stun attacking animals. Flying animals that have been stunned can be ridden around the screen for a short period of time. A round ends when all the desired objects have been collected and placed in the nest. Successive rounds add more objects and enemies, as well as changing the patterns of the shortcuts.</desc>

Pressing the fire button makes his sword fire a tiny shot, while holding it down charges the sword, firing a bigger fireball upon release. Even the smallest enemies take multiple hits, so the standard shot is of little use.</desc>

		<desc>Phozon is an unusual puzzle/arcade hybrid in which the player controls a black molecule with four red spikes. The idea is for the player to align other floating molecules onto their own molecule to create an increasingly complex pattern; this must match the "blue print" molecule that is situated in the middle of the screen. To make molecules adhere to the player's molecule, the player simply touches the target molecule with their own. If a molecule attaches in a place that does not fit the pattern shown in the middle of the screen, the player must press the reject button to make if float away. Groups of multi-coloured rotating spheres move around the screen and must be avoided.</desc>

The planting of the final bomb starts the detonation sequence, players must then quickly reach the level's exit before the bombs explode.

Each level is populated with enemy scientists and agents, and any contact with these will result in the loss of a life. To help combat this, players are armed with a 'stun gun' which will knock the enemy to the floor, allowing the player to pass. If an enemy is held in the stun gun's beam for several seconds, the enemy will fall to the platform below.

At the completion of each level, part of a cartoon picture of woman in a state of undress is shown. The entire picture is revealed once every four levels.</desc>

The Goketsuji Clan is currently the 3rd wealthiest family in the world. As a result, there are many who seek control the clan and the family fortune.

Some train endlessly building up their strength, others polish up their fighting skills with experience, and still others concentrate on their fighting spirit, all for control of the clan.

Because there were so many fighters vying for control of the clan, Oshima, the 3rd Goketsuji Leader, declared the following to all:

The clan will hold a fighting tournament every 5 years. 

The winner of this "test of strength" tournament will assume immediate control of the Goketsuji clan until the next tournament, at which time the seat for control will be open once again. Any member with blood ties to the clan may enter.

One night, Oshima Goketsuji unexpectedly appeared in front of Oume and offered her help to take revenge of Otane.

According to the rules of the clan, if the leader dies or quits, one new tournament should be held immediately to find a successor.

That same night Oshima and Oume sent their servants to dispose of Otane, so while Otane slept, she was kidnapped and thrown to the ocean.

Next day Kuroko found a letter supposedly written by Otane, where she declined to her right to be the leader of the clan.

One week later all the competitors from the previous tournament and other family members were convoked to be informed about Otane's decision and the beginning of a new tournament.</desc>

		<desc>Prehistoric Isle in 1930 is a horizontally scrolling shooting game developed by SNK and released in arcades in 1989. 

Ships have been mysteriously disappearing in the vicinity of the Bahamas for years. Now, in 1930, the United States government sends an expedition to the area in a flying boat to determine the cause. As they survey the ocean, the expedition comes across an uncharted landmass which they dub "Greenhell Isle" and launches two reconnaissance biplanes to take a closer look. As they investigate the island, the biplanes come under attack by dinosaurs and other life forms that were thought to have become extinct millions of years ago. 

The player takes control of a biplane armed with a forward-firing machine gun. It can also be equipped with an option weapon pod that can be rotated clockwise around the craft. The option's attack changes depending on where it is currently positioned:

When directly above or below the plane, the option fires energy waves that reflect back upon contact with a surface.
When diagonally above the plane, the option fires balls of energy that bounce off surfaces at a 45 degree angle.
When diagonally below the plane, the option drops bombs.
When directly in front of the plane, the option replaces the default machine gun with its own flame cannon.
When directly behind the plane, the option deploys aerial mines.</desc>

		<desc>In a time when the industrialization of the world had just begun, various inventions appeared and changed the life of the peaceful kingdom. One of them was a propeller that evolved from pure wind generation by using the created electricity to re-rotate it. It was called 'The Professional Gear', or just 'Progear'. This invention was the key to conquer the great wide open sky. Another discovery made the ancient dream of the immortal body come true. But it was affordable only by some wealthy elderly. They formed a new council called 'the Motorouin' and declared the current government as a corruptive and greedy establishment and that they want to correct it by a new educational system, in order to create a new race of man. So they built a military force to realize the first step of their plan, which was the takeover of the kingdom. The government decided to stop the aggression by putting it's own army in motion. It was a dreadful battle with many victims. But it was won by the Motorouin. This battle is mentioned in the books of history as 'The Punishment of the Sages'.

A group of young pilots, actually children whose families were killed in that war, finally decided to fight back. They secretly developed a new powerful weapon which adults were not able to use. They called it 'Gun Flyer' and installed it in all of their planes. The Storm of Progear was about to begin!</desc>

Naturally, it ain't just about being cool and shooting some b-ball outside of the school: on each side you have a couple of guys who are up to no good, with a constant enthusiasm for making trouble in the neighborhood. As such, Punk Shot joyfully turns basketball into a full-contact sport - heads will be bashed, noses punched, and private parts kicked. To top it off, each court features an assortment of environmental hazards, from slippery banana peels and having your butt set on fire, to the park dogs and their special taste for pants.</desc>

Players control a rotating cannon situated at the center of the spiral and must stop the line of marbles from reaching the goal by shooting matching coloured marbles into the line. If three or more marbles of the same colour are matched, they will disappear.

In addition to standard marbles, bonus marbles occasionally appear that will, for example, temporarily slow down the rate the marbles' advance, or cause all marbles of a certain colour to be destroyed. Also, providing there is a clear line of sight, unwanted marbles can be fired straight out of the play area to prevent them from adding to the advancing line.

All marbles must be destroyed to complete a level. The game is over once the marbles are pushed over the goal threshold.</desc>

		<desc>Uo Poko is a puzzle game for one or two players (co-operative). The aim is to clear the screen of coloured glass balls by dropping like-coloured balls down onto them. Connecting three or more like-coloured balls creates a chain reaction and causes them to disappear.

Balls are launched into the play area via a joystick controlled 'pinball-plunger' and as in Pinball, the further the plunger is pulled back, the further the coloured ball will travel. Mastering the strength and distance required is essential in order to drop each ball accurately onto its target. To allow players to learn how to use the plunger, the first two stages feature a guide line which shows exactly where a ball will drop. From the third stage onwards, players must use their judgement alone.

Bonus points are awarded if a stage is completed quickly enough. If too much time is taken, however, the bottom of the stage will start to rise, pushing the balls already in play towards the top of the screen. If the top of the screen is reached, the game is over.

Uo Poko features thirty stages of play.</desc>

At the start of each level, the playing field is just a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix - a stick-like entity that performs peculiar, erratic motions within the confines of the rectangle. The player controls a small marker that can move around the edges of the rectangle. To claim an area of the screen, the player must detach from an edge and draw Stix within the rectangle. Stix are simply lines traced out by moving the marker. When the marker traces out a closed shape, the area enclosed by the shape becomes solid and has been claimed. The player may draw either Fast Stix, which appear blue when solid, or Slow Stix, which appear red. Slow Stix take longer to draw, but are worth twice as many points. Once the player has claimed an area, the marker can safely move along the border of that claimed area. To complete a level, the player must claim 75% or more of the rectangle's area.</desc>

The action takes place over a number of sideways scrolling levels, the bulk of which consist of straightforward platform action. On some levels, however, there are jet packs for the players to collect, and the gameplay's emphasis switched to that of a standard, sideways scrolling shoot-em-up.

The object of the game is to destroy an army of robots that have taken over an Earth colony satellite station. Each level has a boss character that must be destroyed. Upon its death it releases a door key that must be used to exit the level. Weapon and character power-ups can be collected to aid players in their task.</desc>

		<name>R-Type</name>
		<desc>RType is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the evil Bydo Empire rules the galaxy through fear and intimidation and it's up to the player - piloting their heavily-armed R-9 space ship - to battle through eight tough levels to the heart of the Bydo stronghold and defeat them.

The game's revolutionary weapons system is its real stroke of genius. The first of numerous innovations that R?Type bought to the genre is the beam weapon: when the fire button is held down, a 'power meter' starts to charge up; once the meter is full, releasing the fire button unleashes a very powerful plasma burst capable of inflicting much greater damage to enemy ships or even destroying numerous enemies simultaneously. The trade-off is that charging the weapon takes up valuable seconds, giving the Bydo ships time to attack.

The most significant addition to R-type's arsenal is the now-legendary 'Force Pod'. This takes the form of an invincible, detachable laser-firing pod that can be attached to either the front or rear of the player's ship, or can be detached completely, after which the pod sits some distance either ahead or behind the player's ship, tracking its movements and providing additional fire power. When attached to the R9 ship, the pod acts as a shield. This forms a crucial part of R?Type's gameplay and has to be fully utilised to navigate certain sections of the game, such as the huge mothership that comprises the game's 3rd stage.

R?Type's levels are designed to make full use of its unique weapons system, making for very linear and demanding gameplay in which losing or picking up the wrong weapon at the wrong time often leads to an instant death. Its intelligent, precise and demanding level design, gave the world its first truly 'strategic' shoot-em-up.</desc>

		<name>R-Type II</name>
		<desc>The sequel to the hugely successful original finds the evil Bydo Empire once again intent on the destruction of all mankind in this sideways scrolling, six-level shoot-em-up.

The innovative weapons system of the original game - the 'Beam Weapon' and 'Force Pod' - make a welcome return and remain unchanged for the sequel.

The tight, demanding gameplay and high emphasis on correct usage of the weapons system also return - although the sequel is, if anything, even more demanding than its already unforgiving predecessor; with more durable enemies and trickier level design. 

R?Type II features three new weapon shot types: 
Green - Search Laser - fires semi-homing lasers that can bend at 45Â° angles. 
Grey - Shotgun Laser - fires large shells that travel a short distance before exploding powerfully. 
Scatter Bomb - drops bombs to the ground; when these explode, the explosion scatters forwards along the ground. This is a supporting weapon that can be equipped instead of missiles.

In addition to the new weapons, R-type II's Beam Weapon has received an upgrade. As with the first game, holding down the fire button makes a power gauge fill up, releases the button then unleashes a powerful plasma shot. For the sequel, however, continuing to hold down the button causes the gauge to charge up further. This 'double-charged' gauge flashes blue and red and releases an even more powerful plasma burst.</desc>

		<name>R-Type Leo</name>
		<desc>R-Type Leo is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up and is the third and final arcade release of this classic series (although numerous console-only sequels would follow, see 'Series' for details).

Mankind are currently at peace with their former adversaries, the Bydo Empire, and have taken the opportunity to undertake a massive project called 'Project Paradise'. This involved the construction of an artificial terrestrial-like planet called 'Eden', created as a safe haven should humanity once again find itself under threat. However, soon after construction is completed, 'Major' - the bio-computer system responsible for maintaining Eden - malfunctions, taking control of the planet's defences and launching an attack on mankind. It is up to the newly-developed 'R-9 Leo' fleet to fly in and stop Major's assault on its creators.

R-Type Leo deviates from the gameplay style of its predecessors by removing the use of both the 'Force Pod' and the 'Wave Cannon'. The new weapons are called 'Force Bits' (later identified in "R-Type Final" as "Psy Bits") and the 'Bit Shot'. The three 'Force Bit' weapon types are:
Red - Claw Laser: a powerful horizontal laser beam and horizontal traverse wave
Blue - Mirror Laser: fires multiple, ricocheting lasers.
Green - Search Laser LRG: fires semi-homing lasers that can bend at 90 degree angles.

Unlike previous 'Bit' devices, the 'Force/Psy Bits' are capable of firing either forwards or backwards (their direction dictated by the movement of the ship itself). Finally, the 'Wave Cannon' is replaced by a 'Bit Shot', in which the Psy Bits detach from the ship and collide with the nearest enemy. The Bits can only do this for a limited time before running out of energy, and must be recalled to the ship to recharge.

R Type Leo consists of 6 stages and is the first game in the series to allow 2 players to play simultaneously.</desc>

Some of Racing Hero's stages mirrored the racing-through-traffic gameplay of the Ferrari-based racer, for example perhaps the biggest similarity to Out Run is that at the end of each stage, the player can choose which route he or she wishes to take next. This differs somewhat from "Out Run"'s highly impressive forked-road method. In Racing Hero, the player is presented with a seperate stage-select screen and simply highlights the flag of whichever country they wish to tackle next.</desc>

		<desc>As captain of the Sonic Spaceport, players must defend their station against enemy spaceships called Gamma Raiders, which attack with vengeance and swiftly retreat to formation. The object of the game is to destroy 48 enemy Gamma Raiders before there is total disintegration of all the Spaceports on the player's side.

Players can counterattack with the Rapid-Fire Laser Blaster which zooms the lasers over the three-dimensional-esque field of curving vectors, while it intercepts enemies. The lower on the radar screen that you destroy a Gamma Raider, the more points will be earned. If exploding decoys damage the Sonic Spaceport, the Laser Blaster's firing speed will reduce. The Laser Blaster's "Damage Meter" will light up as damage is incurred and when fully illuminated, will weaken the Laser Blaster's offensive powers. To reverse this, the players must attack and destroy all remaining Gamma Raiders.

Players are given a wide range of flexibility in controlling the difficulty levels of the game. Extra Spaceports are awarded at 7,000, 10,000, 15,000 and 20,000 points, as determined by the players. The initial number of Spaceports may also be pre-programmed at 3, 4, 5 or 6. When the required number of spaceships is destroyed, players receive an extra point bonus.</desc>

The story involves various pairs of martial artists and those with supernatural powers, with everybody having personal motivations for fighting in Sunshine City. Some of these fighters harness the power of dragon spirits (with brothers Billy and Jimmy Lewis controlling the Blue and Red Dragons and main antagonist Johann controlling the Black Dragon).</desc>

The returning heroes have been asked to rescue the Rainbow Islands from the clutches of the various enemies who have overrun the islands in their absence.

Bob and Bob are each armed with the ability to create solid rainbows. This ingenious game-play device acts as both a weapon (to either kill an enemy instantly, or trap it then collapse the rainbow onto it, the latter essential for collecting bonus gems - as detailed in 'Tips and Tricks') and as a temporary platform that allows the players to reach previously inaccessible parts of the level, as they race to reach the top of the island before the game's tight time limit expires.</desc>

Competitors never run out of fuel. Game includes 6 stages, each placed in an American city (from San Francisco to New York) and 2 bonus stages. Difficulty increases progressively and new obstacles like cars, trucks, rivers and ramps come as stages advance.</desc>

With a spaceship, the player shoots several kind of robotic enemies and spaceships. At the end of every stage (except for the first one), the player meets a huge enemy spaceship as the stage's boss. Player's spaceship is equipped with a limited force shield which allows it to resist any kind of attack, though energy drains both while it is active and whenever the ship gets hit during use. Power-ups come in the form of ally helicopters and certain spaceships, that bring to the player a new shot(much faster than the normal one) and refills the ship's force field meter.</desc>

In W.G.P mode, you pick your bike that you want to use, and then race up to ten world circuits, including France, Germany, Italy, U.S.A, Spain, Sweden, and more. You race against the top riders. Try to aim for the top.

R.P.G. mode is interactive. You travel between locations, and explore them, and speak to any people here. You start with no bike, so you must go to the Bike Shop and purchase one. Then with some help with the owner, you can race against up to six opponents. The more races you win, the more money you earn. Keep winning and you will be able to race the Suzuki 8-hour. During this mode, a timer will count down. If this expires, you must insert a coin in order to continue.

Multi-Play mode lets you "link" cabinets together so that two players can race each other side-by-side.</desc>

Unlike the first game, which played like a traditional wrestling game, Ring of Destruction's format was changed to play like a traditional one-on-one 2D fighting game (similar to Super Street Fighter II), with the action restricted to one plane. The game's configuration was changed to a five-button setup (two punch buttons, two kick buttons and a grappling button). The objective of each match is to deplete the opponent's life bar in two out of three rounds. It is no longer necessary for the player to pin their opponent to win a match, although all the other moves have been retained.

A variety of traps and pitfalls await the Road runner - including cannons, land mines and cliff-top drops - that must be carefully avoided or negotiated. It is possible, however, to lure Wile E. Coyote into these traps to put some valuable distance between the Road Runner and his pursuer.

Piles of birdseed are littered throughout the levels and Road Runner must eat them (by running over them) whenever possible, as missing five seed piles will cause Road Runner to feel faint and stop running, resulting in his being caught by Wile E Cayote. A 'Seed Meter' at the top of the screen indicates Road Runner's seed enery level.

Road Runner's colourful, beautifully-drawn graphics capture the spirit and humour of the legendary cartoons perfectly. The music and sound effects are also faithful to the cartoon series.</desc>

The game's story mirrors that of the film, with former cop Murphy, now a half-human cyborg called 'RoboCop', on a quest to bring down the evil OCP corporation.

RoboCop features nine levels of action, with two of the game's nine stages being into-the-screen target ranges, in which players can try to accrue bonus points and earn extra health. Wooden crates occasionally bar RoboCop's progress, but these can be punched to remove them. Marked crates can be smashed to reveal one of three Weapon power-ups; Three-way Gun, Dual Laser and the incredibly powerful Cobra Gun.

The film's incidental music plays throughout the game and RoboCop's speech is sampled directly from the original film.</desc>

Set in the year 2084, Robotron is a single-screen shoot-em-up in which super-intelligent self-aware robots known as 'Robotrons' - designed and built to help mankind - have revolted against their creators and vowed to either reprogram the humans into Robotrons or, failing this, wipe-out the human race entirely. 

The player must destroy the robots and rescue the Earth's remaining human families. The player's only weapon is a multi-directional Anti-Robot Laser Gun. Used effectively, it will give players the power to destroy all the Robot waves, with the exception of the indestructible 'Hulk' unit. 

At the start of the attack wave, players will have three chances to wipe out the enemy and advance to the next wave. Every 25,000 points players are granted another chance to complete their mission. 

MAN, WOMAN, CHILD: These are the only three types of human clones left on Earth. Defenseless and easy prey to the Robots, they are totally dependent upon players for their survival and will wander aimlessly until the player makes contact with them. Touching them will place them under the player's protective powers and earn them the following points: 1,000 for rescuing the 1st human; 2,000 for the 2nd: 3,000 for the 3rd; 4,000 for the 4th; 5,000 for the 5th; and 5,000 for every additional human saved. At the beginning of each new wave and when the player loses a turn, rescue scoring will again begin at 1,000.

		<name>Rod Land</name>
		<desc>Rod-Land is a cute and colourful platform game for one or two players in which two fairy sisters - 'Tam' and 'Rit' - must rescue their kidnapped mother from the 'Maboots Tower' fortress.

The fairies are armed with the 'Rods of Sheesanomo' - two magical rods that enable the fairies to catch enemies in a force-field and slam them into the platforms to kill them - and must clear each level of enemies to move onto the next and eventually reach and infiltrate the Tower.

As well as the magical rods used for attacking enemies, the fairies can also create a magical ladder - in a fashion very similar to that used in Taito's "Rainbow islands" - which can be utilised anywhere on a level and allows players to reach other platforms or escape from pursuing enemies. Each player can utilise only one magically-created ladder at any one time and the creation of a new ladder removes the previously-created one.

A level is only completed when all enemies have been killed. Some defeated enemies drop bonus items, such as fruit, missiles and bombs.

Each of the game's levels features brightly coloured flowers. If players manage to collect all of these, the 'Extra Game' mode begins. During this time-limited mode all of the level's enemies turn red and move much faster. If the enemies are killed in time, they drop an alphabetic letter that can be collected to spell the word 'EXTRA' and earn players an extra life.</desc>

The game features ten different tracks, each with its own graphical theme. After the first race, in addition to the four racing cars a fifth 'drone' vehicle is added, whose sole intention is to hinder the four racers. The drone is visibly different from the racers and can be anything from a steam roller to a cement mixer.</desc>

		<desc>You're a caveman in a big old forest, and life would be great if that pesky pterodactyl wasn't always flying about. Luckily, it only seems to fly around above trees, so you hatch a brilliant plan – get the pterodactyl to fly above only a small patch of forest, and live your life in peace. Who doesn't love a good bit of deforestation, after all? So the idea is to run around the map, chopping down trees until the pterodactyl is trapped in an area of four trees or fewer.

If you find one, you can run a stone wheel across the forest to take out a whole row of trees, but mostly you'll be chopping them down one at a time – and that's a bit of a pain because the enemies here are super aggressive. The pterodactyl can shoot fire at you, a dinosaur runs around the areas you've cleared and can also travel through the forest, and if the very fast mole shows up, you're done for. Different stage layouts with obstacles like rivers and thunder clouds liven things up as you make hard won progress, but only the most persistent gamers will take to Rumba Lumber.</desc>

		<name>Salamander</name>
		<desc>Salamander is a 1 or 2 player sequel to 1985's superb shoot-em-up, "Nemesis". While it retained the same basic gameplay and feel of its predecessor (particularly the superb and innovative weapons system), Salamander featured both superior graphics and a more imaginative approach to level design. The earliest example of the latter appears towards the end of the very first level, in which imposing, organic obstructions grow before the players' eyes. The game's third level - the infamous 'lava' level - is another good example of Salamander's superb design; with huge solar flares constantly erupting both above and below the player's ship that must be carefully navigated to avoid instant loss of life. Salamander introduced further variety to the action with the introduction vertically-scrolling levels, which alternated with the standard side-scrolling levels.

Salamander's weapon power-up system is as follows:
SPEED UP: Five speed levels.
MISSILE: Press missile button to launch.
LASER: Your forward rockets turn into deadly lasers.
RIPPLE LASER: Use shoot button to fire.
FORCE FIELD: Protect your ship with barriers.
MULTIPLE: Increase your fire power by up to four times.

Multiple special powers can be obtained, but the LASER cannot be used in conjunction with the RIPPLE Laser.</desc>

		<name>Satan's Hollow</name>
		<desc>Satan's Hollow is a 1- or a 2-player game. When playing this game, the Rocket Launcher is under YOUR control. YOU make it move back and forth across the screen to launch Rockets that will eliminate your attackers. These attackers are displayed in groups, called 'racks', across the top of the screen. The first rack is made up of a small number of attackers. The second rack is made up of a larger number of these attackers. And intermixed with the racks of attackers is a rack with only a single fire-breathing Devil's head. 

The attackers and the Devil's Head will try to wipe out your Rocket Launcher. If they do, you lose one player. In emergencies, you have a Shield which goes all around your Rocket Launcher for a short period of time. It is activated by pushing the Shield button on the control console. BUT BE CAREFUL!! This consumes a lot of power and will only last a VERY SHORT TIME! 

Each attacker eliminated will cause a Bridge Section to appear at the lower left corner of the screen EXCEPT: when there is already a Bridge Section there or when you have a Bridge Section in tow under your Rocket Launcher. Pick these Sections up with your Rocket Launcher and move them over to build a Bridge across the gorge at the right side of the screen leading into the land of SATAN. 

When you complete your Bridge into the land of SATAN, you can cross it and do battle with him. If you win you will be rewarded by increased fire power for your Rocket Launcher. If SATAN defeats you, you lose one player. 

As your skill level increases, the number of attackers is increased and the speed that the fire-breathing Devil's Head moves is increased also. 

Bonus Rocket Launchers are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each attacker has an assigned point value. 

The object of the game is to HAVE FUN while constantly improving your skills as you play, eliminating as many attackers as possible each time to get the highest score.</desc>

		<desc>Scramble is a sideways scrolling shoot-em-up in which a single player takes control of a spaceship and must try to fight through six different enemy-packed levels - destroying as many fuel tanks and ground intallations as possible - before reaching the enemy base and destroying it. 

Contact with any scenery, ground installations, enemy ships or projectyles results in an instant loss of life. The Scramble ship is armed with both a blaster and bombs. The blaster is forward-firing only while the bombs drop downwards to target ground-based enemy installations and to collect fuel from fuel dumps. 

The fuel dumps are of particular importance, as the player ship's fuel gauge constantly depletes as the player progresses through the game and the only way to re-fuel is by bombing the fuel tanks that are located on the ground throughout the levels. Fuel usage increases as the game progresses, until fuel usage actually outstrips the amount of fuel dumps available and the game becomes impossible. 

Scramble is rightly considered to be a classic and was the world's first ever 'multi-level' shoot-em-up.</desc>

		<desc>Secret Agent is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up which the player takes on the role of a James Bond-esque secret agent who must fight his way through a terrorist group called 'CWD' to reach the final Boss confrontation and prevent a stolen nuclear missile being launched.

The player starts the game armed only with a pistol, and this has a limited amount of ammunition. Once the ammo has run out, players can only kick their enemies. Machine guns are occasionally dropped by defeated enemies and can be picked up and used. Also, Golden Gun components are sometimes dropped; there are six of these in total and once all have been collected, the player is rewarded with a very powerful golden rifle. This weapon kills all enemies instantly but will only last for twenty-five seconds, indicated by a meter at the top-right of the screen.

Most of the game's eight stages are platform-based, but there are also two underwater scuba levels and a motorbike chase. All of the game's end-of-level bosses reappear on the final 'underground lair' level.

While not officially licensed as a James Bond game, Secret Agent is unmistakably meant to represent both the Bond character and movie series. The Bond villain Jaws shows up at the end of stage two and another famous Bond villain, Odd Job also appears. Another memorable Bond reference is the use of a Shaun Connery impersonator who tells players that they have done a Great job upon completion of a level.</desc>

The player maneuvers the space ranger throughout the enemy space station, which consists of 26 alphabetically ordered corridors known as "sections", starting from Section A and ending at the titular Section Z. The game is divided into five stages, each consisting of five sections (with the final stage having six sections to accommodate the spare letter). The player will fight an enemy boss at the end of each stage, concluding with the final battle against the "L Brain" at Section Z. The game's stages alternates between horizontal-scrolling stage (left or right) and upwards vertical-scrolling stages. The player will lose a life every time they get hit by enemy fire. Additional lives can be obtained if the player achieves a high enough score. The game will be over if the player loses all of their lives, although a chance to continue will be provided.

The controls consists of an eight-way joystick and two buttons, one for shooting and the other for changing the character's aim to the left or right. This allows the player to shoot at one direction while moving away towards the opposite. The player will shoot their rifle towards the left or the right with the fire button, while dropping bombs at the same time to the ground. By destroying certain dome-shaped containers, the player can obtain one of three power-up items represented by letters: S, P, and B. S increases the player's mobility speed, while P increases their firing power; each can improved for up to three increments. However, these power-ups will be lost whenever the player loses a life. The B item will simply give the player bonus points</desc>

		<name>Segasonic The Hedgehog</name>
		<desc>Segasonic The Hedgehog is a scrolling, isometric racing game for one to three players featuring Sega's legendary mascot, 'Sonic the Hedgehog'. Sonic's nemesis, 'Dr. Robotnik', is once again intent on World domination and is preparing to launch his latest attack from his new island base, Eggman Island.

When 'Sonic', 'Ray', and 'Mighty' drop in to thwart his plans, Robotnik catches them with one of his devious machines. After finding themselves imprisoned in a tower, the trio break free onto the island, and proceed to make their escape and try to defeat Robotnik and his evil plans.

Sega Sonic's gameplay retains elements of the original console games, such as Sonic's ability to jump on the heads of enemies to kill them. The golden rings that Sonic collects are also included. Each level is littered with Dr Robotnik's devious traps; with lava flows, collapsible platforms, locked gates etc. all serving to hamper Sonic's progress.</desc>

		<name>Sexy Parodius</name>
		<desc>Sexy Parodius is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players and is the third sequel in a series originally created as a parody of Konami's own successful "Gradius" games. As with the prequels, Sexy Parodius again gives players a choice of increasingly bizarre ships to control; ranging from a sexy girl riding a missile, to a stick man on a paper aeroplane.

The game plays much the same as previous Parodius games, as well as the 'Gradius' series it sets out to parody. One new addition to the game-play is the introduction of branching paths through the game. Each level has a specific task, such as collecting the golden coins on the second level, the completion or failure of which dictates which level players will be faced with next.

In a co-operative two-player game, when certain characters are close enough, a third shot appears between them, these can either be purple shots that swirl all over the screen, hearts that home in on enemies, or rockets that shoot straight ahead. This feature was first seen in Konami's 1990 shoot-em-up, "Lightning Fighters".

The playable characters in sexy Parodius are:
Vic Viper/Lord British
Michael/Gabriel
Hikaru/Akane
Ivan/Toby
Mambo/Samba
Koitsu/Aitsu
Option/Multiple
Shooting Star/Black Viper</desc>

		<desc>Shadow Force is a side-scrolling platform beat-em-up for one or two players, who choose to play as one of four Ninjas and must use all the means at their disposal to free the world from the grip of the evil Dr. Wong and his terrifying 'Theaser' organization.

Shadow Force has 6 buttons: 2 for punches (low and high) 2 for kicks (low and high) 1 for jumping and 1 for possessing an enemy. Additional attack moves can be utilised by moving the joystick up or down and pressing punch and kick buttons. It's also possible to combine punch and kick attacks to obtain different combos and while the enemies can do the same, the number and variation of their attacks is generally lower than those available to the players.

In addition to being able to possess nearby enemies, Shadow Force also features something else new to the side-scrolling beat-em-up genre; at the end of each stage players take part in a bonus round consisting of a one-on-one fight. 

Players can choose to start on any one of the first three stages and the game features 14 different possible endings.</desc>

		<desc>Shinobi is a scrolling platform beat-em-up in which the player takes on the role of Joe Musashi, a Shinobi Ninja, who must fight his way through 5 tough missions - each made up of between 3 to 5 stages - in his quest to rescue the kidnapped Ninja children of the Iga clan; now hostages of an evil Ninja syndicate called "Zeed". To complete a mission, the player must rescue all of the kidnapped children on each level, with the number of hostages remaining displayed on a meter in the bottom left corner of the screen.

Shinobi was a huge success for Sega, and deservedly so. Its perfectly realized blend of platform and fighting action and is as fine an exponent of the 'easy to get into, difficult to master' gameplay ethic as video games have seen.</desc>

The object of the game is to go toward the end of the level and defeat the end-of-level boss, which is usually a huge vehicle. Crates that are scattered throughout the levels can be broken into to reveal new weapons and power-ups.

There is a team mode where players have to select three characters. The characters can be switched on-the-fly during gameplay, which is useful if one of them is badly injured. Players can use the other teammates until life-ups can be found.</desc>

		<desc>Shogun Warriors plays similarly to some other 2D versus fighting games during its release, which the player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. It is controlled with an 8-way joystick and 4 buttons that perform weak and strong versions of punches and kicks. In one player mode, after selecting a character, the arcade randomly selects an opponent. The opponent order goes randomly and always leaves the last four bosses in a certain order. Some characters stabbed by ones armed with katanas or other sharp weapons can cause blood to spurt out, which became popularized a few months later by Midway's Mortal Kombat. The main unique feature of Shogun Warriors is its "grabbing system". When the player is grabbed by the opponent, the grabber must move the joystick left and right to make it more difficult for his opponent to escape, while the one being grabbed must rapidly press any or all buttons to make it easier to escape.</desc>

Keep the galaxy safe for all its sinizens! Fiendish Worker ships from the planet Sporg will attempt to fabricate a Sinistar from the remains of derelict planetoids in your very sector. You must not let them do this for two reasons: 
1) These planetoids contain the life-sustaining crystals that your civilization requires for its vital technologies. 
2) With the eminently unstable Sinistar in their possession, the Sprogites can lay waste to any civilization in your sector. You alone stand in their way. 

You must mine the sinisite crystals. Williams has equipped you with the latest heuristic electret cannon technology. All you need to do is aim at a planetoid and shoot. Now collect your motherlode! 

In fact, only with sinisite can you manufacture sinibombs to eradicate the Sinistar. But you must also rebuff the Workers and disintegrate their even more aggressive comrades-at-arms, the evil skelomorphic Warriors! Intelligent beings everywhere depend on your courage, your dedication, your reserve, your shrewd command of tactical invention! It's up to you, space cadet!</desc>

Players travel back in time starting in Great Britain 1945, Germany 1915, Japan 1945, Germany 1944, Vietnam 1974, France 1914, Russia 1974 and finally the space station in the present time, 2110. Each time stage has two levels, both ending in a boss battle save for the final stage, resulting in a total of 15 Areas.

The ship's weapon system is accessed in the beginning of each stage. The shipâ€™s main shot consists of a semi-automatic Wave Shot. The shipâ€™s bomb weapons include forward firing missiles, fireballs, homing missiles and the buster bomb. The ship can be equipped with only one bomb weapon from either category at a time. The ship can only be loaded with a certain number of Bomb weapons and they can only be resupplied at the end of the level. The only pick-up item in the game is a parachuting human pilot shot down from malfunctioning fighter planes/jets; collecting these pilots results in random bonus points.</desc>

		<name>Snow Bros. - Nick &amp; Tom</name>
		<desc>One or two players take on the roles of snowmen Nick and Tom as they battle a variety of monsters over fifty platform-based, single screen levels. 

The snowmen can throw snowballs at the enemies with the aim of encasing them completely in snow. The encased enemies can then be kicked in order to destroy them and this is achieved by standing next to the snowball and pressing the "kick out" button. This sends the giant snowball flying around the screen, killing any enemies that lay in its path. 

If players take too much time to complete a stage, an evil pumpkin head will appear and try to kill them. The pumpkin is invincible but can be stunned with snowballs. After a short time the evil pumpkin will spawn ghosts that can travel freely around the stage as they seek out Nick and Tom. These ghosts can't be killed or stunned, so the player's only hope is to avoid them while eliminating the remaining standard enemies, to move on to the next screen as soon as possible.

When players defeat an enemy, it may drop a coloured potion bottle. These can be picked up and act as power-ups:
Yellow = Long shot
Red = Speed up
Blue = Bigger snowballs (encases monsters quicker)
Green = Inflates the players like a balloon and lets them fly around the screen, killing any monsters they touch.

Every 10th level features a battle with a large end-of-level boss.</desc>

Each wall has a moving cannon mounted that will fire odd shaped torpedoes at your ship. Scattered around the inside will be a bunch of pellets in various simple patterns. To complete each level you have to drive over, or shoot all of the pellets. If done quickly enough the game will skip a level (going from 1 to 3, etc), and award you point for the level skipped.

If you select Novice difficulty at the beginning, the Solar Fox's normal speed will be slow, and pressing the Speed Button will speed it up. If you should select Expert difficulty, its normal speed will be faster, and pressing the Speed Button will slow it down. Every fourth rack is also a bonus rack, and if you die in one, it will not cost you a life. After clearing ten racks, a player becomes a member of the "10-Rack Club" and the game will continue on as normal.</desc>

		<name>Sorcer Striker</name>
		<desc>Sorcer Striker, released in Japan as Mahou Daisakusen (Magic Armageddon) is a 1993 medieval-themed scrolling shooter developed by Raizing (now known as Eighting) for the arcades and later ported to Sharp X68000 and FM Towns computers and the EZweb mobile phones. It is the first game in the Mahou Daisakusen trilogy, which includes Kingdom Grandprix and Dimahoo.
The game is set in a fantasy world filled with magic and magic-fueled machinery. A peaceful kingdom is under assault by the encroaching Gobligan Empire, led by a mysterious human leader known only as the Gobligan King. As the kingdom finds itself unable to drive off the Gobligan Empire's advances, King Codwenna announces a huge bounty for the Gobligan King's head. Four heroes answer the call, and set out to defeat the Gobligan King and restore peace to the kingdom.

Characters
Gain, the Warrior: A master of swords and physical combat, Gain wanders the land with his pet monkey Shain in search of the ultimate weapon. Attracted by the large bounty offered for the Gobligan King, Gain takes up arms in his ship, the Valhallyzer, against the Gobligan Empire. His signature weapon is the Buster Sword.
Chitta, the Magician: Despite her appearance as a youthful girl, Chitta is a formidable magic user and the granddaughter of a legendary hero. Bored of the quiet life of her village, she sneaks away in her grandfather's magical ship, the Gun Dalf, to seek adventure. Her signature attacks are the Thunder Beam and Ice Cube.
Miyamoto, the Samurai Dragon: Well-mannered and wise, Miyamoto the samurai dragon seeks revenge against Tsumujimaru, one of his former disciples. Tsumujimaru turned his back on Miyamoto's teachings and murdered Miyamoto's own Master, then fled into the Gobligan Empire. Miyamoto does not use a magical ship, but rather flies with his own two wings, and attacks via shuriken, ninjutsu stones, and other secret techniques.
Bornnam, the Necromancer: Detested and shunned by society, Bornnam lives in seclusion, practicing the black arts of necromancy and gleefully collecting bones. He decides to fight against the Gobligan Empire as a chance to test his power. Via the power of the divine dragon skull that rests on his head, he is able to transform into the Golgodian, a "ship" form that enables him to fly in the air and absorb the ambient mana from the sky in order to cast his spells. His favorite attacks are the Skull Napalm and Search Ghost.

The game's enemies are as abstract as its setting; with creatures including prehistoric Mammoths, alien pods, giant mushrooms and, at the end of most stages, a huge, fireball-spitting Chinese Dragon.

The player's on-screen counterpart carries a portable jetpack under his arm which allows him to fly. The player can also run along the ground to avoid overhead structures and enemies.

In addition to its flight capability, the jetpack is also equipped with a laser, used to destroy both the game's many enemies as well as some (but not all) obstructions, such as the trees and floating rocks on the first stage.

Space Harrier has a total of 18 stages, each with a boss fight at the end. Three exceptions are the bonus stages (5th and 12th) and the 18th stage, which is a 'boss rush' featuring some of the bosses encountered up to that point.</desc>

There are now 3 different game modes to choose from. These include a faithful recreation of the legendary original - available in both upright and cocktail versions - and replete with a simulation of the infamous "coloured plastic overlay" that was used to add the impression of full colour graphics to the original game.

The 2 remaining game modes are 'Versus', with simultaneous split-screen 2-player action, and "Parody", which features characters and graphics from other well-known Taito games, such as "The New Zealand Story", "Bubble Bobble" and "Liquid Kids". Despite the graphical changes, the Parody version plays identically to the original game, and all modes retain the original, legendary sound effects.</desc>

To do this, the spelunker must find the exit to each cave, so he can move on to the next and get closer to his goal.

Spelunker is a platform game, and each tricky cave is filled with enemies - such as bats and ogres - and traps. Ladders, ropes, lifts and the obligatory minecarts must be used to reach other platforms and sections of the cave.

To aid him in his difficult quest, the Spelunker carries a gun and can shoot short-range fireballs at his enemies to stun or kill them. Numerous bonus items can be collected, such as bombs to destroy any rocks block his route, keys to open locked doors and potions to boost the caver's ever-decreasing energy meter. Treasure chests also litter each cave, and can be opened for bonus treasure items.</desc>

The heroes must fight their way through four levels of Dr. Doom's villains; including Venom, The Scorpion, The Lizard, The Green Goblin, The Sandman, The Kingpin, The Hobgoblin, Electro, Dr. Octopus and, of course, Dr. Doom himself.

Each player character has a different weapon or power that can be used throughout the game while fighting. Spider-Man uses his webs, The Black Cat uses her 'cat's claw' grappling hook and cable, Hawkeye uses his bow and arrows and The Sub-Mariner uses his hydro-electric charges. The game's viewpoint pans in and out between alternate large and small scale (4-way scrolling) sections. The game's 'camera' zooms out on alternate levels with the zoomed-out view introducing four-way scrolling platform sections to the gameplay. The game ends when the fourth and final chapter has been completed.</desc>

One of the new gameplay mechanics introduced in "3rd Strike" is the Guard Parry, also known as the 'Red Parry', which allows players to parry during guard stun, providing the timing is correct. Another new feature is after-match player evaluations in which the winner of a two-person match is graded in Offense, Defence, Tech and Extra. In single-player Arcade mode the player will always be evaluated, even in event of a loss. The grades range from E (lowest) to MSF, or Master Street Fighter (highest).</desc>

Their mission was to conquer the world. CANY activity was found in areas like the Soviet Union, America, Japan, and even Germany. It is revealed that CANY had weapons never seen before from rockets to mechanical walkers. The world quickly formed a group of pilots and planes called the Strikers whose mission is to rid of CANY from the world.</desc>

		<desc>The player chooses one of six planes or can opt for a random choice. The first four stages are in random order, while the last four are sequential. Players collect weapon powerups, bombs, and gold bars for points. Each plane has a unique "supershot" which is charged by damaging enemies and fired by holding then releasing the fire button. Supershots can be stored, although the number varies from plane to plane. Using a bomb results in a large friendly fighter swooping onto the screen and blocking shots while returning fire for a few seconds.

After the player beats the final boss, the game starts again from the beginning, albeit at a much higher difficulty level. All level are similar to the ones in Strikers 1945 II. Only one of the four bosses that are randomly chosen and the sixth boss is changed.</desc>

The object of the game is to invade ten SUPER COBRA defense systems of increasing difficulty and safely pick up the BOOTY.

Use the joystick to move up, down, accelerate and decelerate. Use the Laser and Bombs to destroy defenders. Hitting tanks scores Mystery Value worth 100, 200, or 300 points. Rockets, Tanks, Missiles, and UFO&amp;#039;s may all fire at invader. Hit fuel tanks for extra fuel for CHOPPER. The Chopper uses up fuel as it flies, except in between defense levels.

At 10000 points, the player is awarded a BONUS CHOPPER.

At the end of the game, the player can continue at the defense level he left off on by depositing extra coins and pressing the discharge button on the left-hand side of the panel.

If the Booty is destroyed on the BASE level, the player may try again. When the Booty is safely recovered, a Bonus Chopper is awarded and play resumes at defense level Number 1 where the fuel is used up faster and the defenders fire more often.

 Fuel Tanks appear on every defense level.
 Tanks appear and fire on all levels except level 8 where they do not fire.
Level 1 - Player must maneuver the chopper over mountainous terrain against fast and slow firing rockets.

		<desc>Super Gem Fighter: Mini Mix / Pocket Fighter is a superb, abstract and humorous fighting game featuring miniaturized renditions from several Capcom fighting games; including the legendary "Street Fighter" series, as well as "Darkstalkers" and the little-known "Red Earth".

During a bout, players will be able to release coloured gems from successful attacks against their opponent, as well as from wooden chests that regularly appear. Collecting these gems will 'power-up' the player's character, giving them more powerful attacks. There are two bars and three sub-bars in the interface. The two main bars are the life bar and the super bar; the first indicates the player's health and the second their ability to throw super combos. The Super Bar itself can be filled up to nine levels, allowing players to execute more super combos. Each super combo has a level assigned to it, and it uses Super Bars depending on it.</desc>

		<name>Super Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>Super Pac-Man is a 1- or 2-player game where you are in control of the legendary Pac-Man. As in the original "Pac-Man" game, the goal is to clear each maze, but this time, instead of dots, the maze consists of prizes which are locked away behind gates. There are two ways to access the prizes. You can eat the keys which open a particular gate, and not always the gate which is closest to that key. Or you can crash through the gate after you eat a Super Pill and become Super Pac-Man. You are not required to eat all of the keys in order to complete the stage. 

Four Power Pills are in maze and allow Pac-Man to turn the tables on the ghosts and eat them for a short time. When the ghosts begin to flash, time is running out and they will switch back, so beware. 

New in this game is the Super Pill. There are two Super Pills in the maze which allow Pac-Man to become Super Pac-Man for a limited period of time. While in Super form, Pac-Man can crash through the maze gates, fly over the ghosts and avoid being killed (or eat them when they're blue), and travel at super speed whenever the player presses and holds the Super Speed button. When the super power is about to run out, Pac-Man flashes white and then returns to his normal form. You can extend the duration of Super time by eating a regular Power Pill. The Super time will then be extended by the duration of the ghosts' blue time. 

Pac-Man loses one life whenever a ghost catches him when the ghost is not blue and Pac-Man is not in Super form. You start with a set number of lives ('Lives' dip switch), and bonus lives can be awarded to you as you reach or pass certain preselected point values ('Extra Lives' dip switch). 

The tunnel is a great way to put some space between you and any ghosts that are on your tail since they can only move half as fast as you when they are in it. In Super Pac-Man, the ghosts are also slowed down by travelling through the passage directly beneath the ghost pen.

Occasionally, a star will appear in the middle of the screen with a picture on the left, and a rotating picture on the right. You may eat the star at any time for bonus points, but if you manage to eat the star when the right picture matches the left one, you will receive a larger bonus. 

As the stages increases, the ghosts speed up their pursuit of Pac-Man and they stay blue for shorter and shorter periods of time after he eats a Power Pill until, in the high stages, they do not turn blue at all. 

Super Pac-Man also features bonus stages in Stage 3, Stage 7, and every fourth stage thereafter, where there are no ghosts, a time limit, and Pac-Man is in Super form throughout the stage. Your goal is to eat all of the prizes in the given time limit. As with gameplay on the regular levels, you don't need to eat all (or any) of the keys. You are awarded the remaining time in the counter as points for successfully eating everything. With each Bonus stage, the walls and gates change color.

		<name>Super Pang</name>
		<desc>Super Bang is a sequel to the 1989 original in which one or two players control characters armed with harpoon guns who must destroy the numerous different-sized balloons that bounce around each single-screen stage. When hit by a harpoon, the balloons break down into smaller fragments, in a similar fashion to Atari's 1979 classic, "Asteroids". 

Players can only fire the harpoon guns virtually upwards but can move left and right and climb the ladders that appear on many of the stages. The game has two different modes of play:

PANIC MODE
In this mode, players face an endless rain of bubbles and must simply last as long as possible. The default weapon is the bubble shot and cannot be changed at any time. Each time a bubble is popped, a rainbow bar at the bottom is slowly filled. Filling the bar all the way raises the level number and the bar depletes back to zero. As more bubbles are popped, both remaining and incoming bubbles move faster. A 'Panic' music plays when there's a very large amount of bubbles on the screen, but the normal music returns once enough bubbles are popped.

There is also one special type of bubble that appears rarely. The bubble has a clock image engraved. Whenever the bubble bounces, the engraving changes to a star, and when the bubble bounces again, the engraving changes back to a clock. Popping the bubble when the clock engraving is present causes all bubbles to stop movement completely for 9 seconds, while popping the bubble when the star engraving is present causes all bubbles to be popped and the game screen gets cleared.

TOUR MODE
In this mode players move from stage to stage, travelling around the world. The introductory stage is set in Japan and is the only stage set in this location. After Japan, players travel to parts of Asia, Europe and the Americas. Each location has three stages, with each set at a different time of day: daytime, evening and night. The few exceptions to the three-stage rule are Venice (evening and night stages only), The Mayan Ruins and the Caribbean Sea (both having only day and evening stages).

Each stage has a set layout, consisting of walls, destructible glass walls, invisible walls, ladders and ice. There are forty different stages in the Tour mode.</desc>

		<name>Super Real Darwin</name>
		<desc>SRD: Super Real Darwin is a vertical scrolling shooter arcade game developed and published by Data East. It is the sequel to Data East's 1986 arcade game, Darwin 4078. The player takes control of a small fighter ship capable of mutating into different shapes. The ship's appearance will change with upgraded weapons as the player obtains more powerups.

The story starts on the planet Lakya where the technologically advanced inhabitants of the planet unwittingly unleash the planet's life force known as Evol. As the released Evol drifts from planet Lakya, it is received by the inhabitants of the nearby planet Cokyo; the people of Cokyo initiate the Shlohe project, a plan to use their captured Evol to develop advanced biologic ships and weapons to invade planet Lakya. The inhabitants of Lakya retaliate the Cokyo invasion by using their own evolving fighter ships.</desc>

		<name>Super Space Invaders '91</name>
		<desc>Export versionof "Majestic Twelve - The Space Invaders Part IV".
The third sequel to Taito's seminal "Space Invaders", Majestic Twelve leaves the classic Invaders game-play intact, but adds a slew of new alien invaders and power-ups to the mix. This, together with the vastly improved graphics that introduce colorful new backdrops - some of which scroll vertically in a similar fashion to the star-field in Namco's "Galaxian" - ensure that Majestic 12 is a worthy sequel to the legendary original.

The original game's flying saucer still makes an appearance, but instead of merely awarding bonus points when shot - as in the original game - it now drops a power-up pod for the player to retrieve. Power-ups include shield, faster shots, a laser (activated with the second button) and a giant butterfly, which freezes the invaders for a limited time.

One of the game's most memorable features was the 'Cattle Mutilation' bonus screen, in which the player must protect a heard of cattle from a number of fast-moving saucers, intent on stealing the animals. If a cow is snatched; the player must shoot the relevant saucer to free it; being careful not to actually shoot the cow itself. The '91 incarnation also introduced 'bosses' to the series for the first time; giant, screen-filling aliens that required several shots to kill.

Another major difference to the previous games in the series is that if an invader reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will simply lose a ship (in the original, the game would end once an alien had landed). Also, the player's ship now comes equipped with a shield that can withstand several hits. The shield's strength is depleted every time it takes a direct hit from one of the invaders, and too many hits will result in the shield disappearing altogether. A direct hit on an un-shielded ship will result in the loss of a player life.</desc>

Up to three T-MEK cabinets can be linked for six-player competitions.

In 1995 Time Warner Interactive released an updated version called T-MEK: The Warlords. In addition to the ability to play as a boss MEK by entering his name, the update added a "beginner" difficulty mode, instructional screens on how to play the game, new combos moves and more.</desc>

Doors at the top and bottom of the screen will then open allowing the player to move on to the next level. In addition to the hoppers, each room has its own kind of nasties that attack and attempt to kill the player. It's also necessary to pay attention to the left and right walls which will start moving towards the centre and ultimately crush the player if the level is not completed fast enough. In addition to the regular fire, it is possible to use smart bombs which kill the nasties and stop the walls. Smart bombs can be collected in bonus rooms which appear between the regular levels.</desc>

		<desc>Terra Cresta is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set over a constantly scrolling landscape of islands and enemy installations. The player is under constant attack from enemy spaceship waves, ground-based guns and turrets, dinosaurs and three different mothercraft ships. 

The levels are littered with ground-based silos bearing numbers between 2 and 5. These can be shot to release a player ship component, which then attaches to the player's current ship, increasing both its size and firepower. Power-ups available are 2-Wide shot, 3-Rear Shot, 4-Front cannon and 5-Rear shield. 

Using the 'Formation' button splits the ship parts into a formation for limited time, giving increased fire power. The number of parts acquired determines the formation. For example, if the player has picked up two ship parts then a triangle is formed, with the player's main ship at the rear of the formation, with additional two ship components positioned at the front edge of the triangle. 

When all four numbered parts have been collected, the player's ship transforms into a flaming Phoenix, and is indestructible for a limited time.</desc>

He is armed with an ax and also has a magic lightning spell that can be powered-up two times. Magic upgrades and health potions can be found in small stone pillars. The player needs to beat monsters in a number of locales, jumping across pits and fighting bosses at the end of stages. Two-palyer co-op is supported, with the second player being palette-swap of Player 1.

The game was designed by Tokuhiro Takemori who previously worked on Legendary Axe, and the basic game mechanic is similar -- in order to deal heavy blow with the axe the player needs to stop swinging it for a while. The NES version released after the Arcade game, while generally having same gameplay, features completely different level layouts, enemy designs and story.</desc>

The game is based on the archetypal Hollywood action blockbuster and features a filmic score to back up the on-screen action. The player's only weapon is a whip - another nod to the Indiana Jones character - which can be used to both attack enemies and as a 'rope', to enable the player to reach distant platforms.</desc>

In &amp;#039;The End&amp;#039; you control a ship whose mission is to zap as many bug-ships as possible, before you run out of lives, or the bugs manage to spell out the word END with little chunks of brick. You can move left and right, and the bugs attack from the top of the screen, coming out of a large mothership. But the bugs have another mission besides just blindly attacking you. That other mission is to systematically steal the bricks from your three bases, and use them to spell out the word END up near the top of the screen.</desc>

		<name>The King of Dragons</name>
		<desc>The King of Dragons is a 1991 side-scrolling hack and slash video game by Capcom that allows players to choose from five characters (Elf, Wizard, Fighter, Cleric, and Dwarf) in order to travel through the kingdom of Malus and defeat the monsters that have taken over, as well as their leader, the red dragon Gildiss. Like Capcom's Knights of the Round, it features a level advancement system, allowing character attributes to be upgraded as players progress through the game. The setting is very similar to that of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other medieval fantasy worlds, with familiar monsters such as Orcs, Gnolls, Harpies, Wyverns, Cyclopes, and Minotaurs.

The game was ported to the Super NES and released in 1994. An emulated version of the game was released as part of Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 and Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded.</desc>

Each team consists of three fighters for each player, the winner being the player who is able to eliminate the other team first. Each active character can charge up "Art of Fighting" style in order to gain access to "Desperation Moves", or "DMs" (moves which operate very much like Street Fighter's Super Combos). Playing against the computer, the player must defeat all 8 teams in the game in order to reach the final boss, Rugal Bernstein.</desc>

		<desc>SNK's flagship series returns for another year. Many of the changes in this year's KOF release come in the form of improved graphics, sound effects, music and totally redone character sprites. The gameplay of the system has been altered with the addition of "Rush" multi-hit combos and new moves for practically every character. The storyline of the series receives heavy focus in this release with the Orochi Saga swinging into high-gear. Other features carried over from the previous year include the ability to choose between the default "Team Fighting" mode or the traditional "Single Fighter" style of gameplay, plus the "Versus" and "Survival" gameplay modes.</desc>

New characters include the New Face Team, the Fatal Fury Outlaw Team (featuring the KOF debut of "Blue" Mary Ryan and Ryuji Yamazaki, and the return of Billy Kane), and Kyo's pupil Shingo Yabuki. In total, The King of Fighters '97 sports 29 separate characters.</desc>

The new battle begins here!

Along with K', six new characters and two Kyo Kusanagi clones appear as Edit Mode characters. This means players can choose their favorite from a whopping total of 30 characters!

FOUR MAKES ONE FOR FEARSOME BATTLES
3-on-3 is old hat. From now on, it's 4-on-4, buster. Each team consists of three contestants, along with the Striker (who specializes in Tag Team attacks and brings new possibilities to battle strategies). Push the B and C buttons simultaneously to summon the Striker at any time during a fight (up to five times in a single match), but don't go nuts! Using the Striker at the right time is the key to victory!

INCREASE YOUR POWER GAUGE ENERGY
Increasing Power Gauge energy above a certain point lets players stockpile up to three separate Power Gauges. When gauges are sufficiently stockpiled, use them to activate Super Special Moves and awesome feats like the Guard Cancel Emergency Evasion and Guard Cancel Blow-Away Attack.

SELECT YOUR POWER UP MODE
Use up to three power gauges at once to enter the timed Power Up Mode! There are two types of Power Up Modes to select from by entering special button commands: Counter Mode (press A + B + C to use Super Special Moves whenever you want; can also link normal special moves for Super Cancellation Attacks) or Armor Mode (press B + C + D to increase your defensive power significantly; Super Special Moves cannot be used during this mode).</desc>

The King of Fighters 2002 also has five characters exclusive to the X-Box, the PS2 and/or Dreamcast systems: Shingo Yabuki, King, Geese Howard, "Riot of the Blood" Iori and Leopold Goenitz. Shingo and King are available on all the non-Neo Geo systems, while Geese and the rest are only available on the PS2 and X-Box platforms.

The gameplay system has also changed. The striker system and four-character teams found in the last three KOF releases have been totally removed. In their place are the old-school three man teams and the "Advanced system" from The King of Fighters '97 and The King of Fighters '98.

You can change at any time during a match, but you cannot when two of your teammates have been taken out, and only one character is left in reserve.</desc>

		<name>The Outfoxies</name>
		<desc>A platform 'versus' shoot'em up in which either one player (playing against the computer) or two players (playing against each other) attempt to destroy each other by any means necessary. The levels themselves are interesting and varied, with airships, planes etc. providing a detailed and highly interactive backdrop in which the players do battle. That interactivity is increased further with the introduction of destructible sections which, when blown up, can often open up new areas or rooms. Each level is littered with a variety of weapons that can be picked up and utilized by the player(s). Graphically, Outfoxies employed superb sprite scale and rotation techniques that elevated the already fun gameplay still further. The aeroplane level, for instance, dips and sways, bringing problems of inertia and gravity to the platform action. Also; the in-game camera zooms in and out of the level, depending on how far away the two opponents are from each other. Playable characters range from a monkey to a pair of psychotic school children, with each character choice offering the player different aptitudes (the monkey can jump higher, for example). A fun enough game in one-player mode, Outfoxies really came into its own when two human protagonists took part.</desc>

		<name>Thrash Rally</name>

Using basic controls: accelerate with automatic transmission, brake and a combination of both to power drift, you have to follow a set path of courses. In the World Championship, each location consists of different stages that need to be finished in a single run. There is a strict time limit and you receive a time bonus upon finishing a section. The Dakar mode is one long track without stops. The championship uses regular cars, but in the Dakar race you can also choose a sand buggy, off-road bike or a truck.

A global ranking is kept while racing, but it is based on your time, not on the number of cars you pass during the race. Aside from your opponents, you'll also find water, animals, hills, bridges, bushes and different obstacles in your path.</desc>

		<desc>Taking control of a heavily-armed battle chopper, the player must battle through a variety of both overhead and 'into-the-screen' 3-D stages.

Thunder Blade consists of four stages, which are as follows:
Stage 1: The game begins in a skyscraper-packed city. Enemies consist of rival choppers, jets, and ground-based tanks and gun emplacements. The level ends over the sea, with the player facing a huge and heavily-armed battleship. 
Stage 2: This stage begins with the player navigating a desert canyon, before switching to the into-the-screen view and taking the player through a number of stalactite-packed and densely populated caves. A huge ground-based tank awaits the player at the end of the stage.
Stage 3: This begins in a river canyon, before moving on to a rain-forest river network. As well the the usual line-up of enemies, heavily-armed boats are introduced. the end-of-level battle takes place in the skies as the player attempts to destroy a massive jet fighter.
Stage 4: The 4th and final stage begins with a repeat of the first stage's city level, only this time the action takes place at night. The second half of this stage takes the player deep into an industrial complex, eventually leading to an end-of-game showdown with a massive and heavily-armed gun emplacement.</desc>

		<desc>Taking place in the future of space colonization, the planet Haniamu IV is under attack from a relentless, unknown military force known only as Black Impulse. The strongest Earth ships capable of stopping the total conquering of the planet are the Blue Thunder M-45 (player 1) and the Red Thunder M-24 (player 2).

Thunder Cross is a classic horizontal shooter with 7 stages. Players control the Thunder fighter with up to four "options", which arrange up and down vertically and add to the player's attack power. Three weapons are selectable ranging from the Vulcan shot to the Laser and the Boomerang shot (which doubles as a ricochet weapon). Typical of a Konami shooter, Thunder Cross forces the player to beat the game twice in a harder loop of the first seven levels.</desc>

		<name>Timber</name>
		<desc>Timber is an abstract action game in which one or two players assume the role of a lumberjack and have a limited amount of time to chop down a given number of trees that pop up from the ground. The game is controlled with two joysticks, with one stick controlling the player's movement and the other corresponding to left or right chops with the player's axe. Difficulty increases with each level, with the number of trees needed to be chopped down gradually increasing (maxing out at 19) and the allotted time decreasing. 

During a round players must avoid beehives that are thrown at them by grizzly bears. The beehives, however, can be destroyed with the player's axe for a 500-point reward. Some trees contain birds that will run around the level after they have been chopped down, awarding 1,000 points if touched by the player.

Every couple of levels players are given the opportunity to amass bonus points. The bonus round begins with the lumberjack standing on a floating log. As the log begins to rotate, players must use their reflexes to stay on top of the log. The first two times this is played, the log is relatively large; on future attempts, the size of the log shrinks considerably. The bonus round ends if the player falls off the log or balances atop it for the duration of the round, in which case 1,000 bonus points are earned.

The two-player simultaneous mode can be played either competitively or cooperatively. In this mode, chopping or pushing down a tree such that it falls on the opponent awards you with 1,000 points.</desc>

They have the power to drop their Tinker power balls, which are both invulnerable to the enemies, and move around by pressing the Line button, therefore creating a line between them and their power balls. Releasing the button makes their power balls come back to them; the enemies are killed by having the power balls slam into them. There are also pieces of popcorn which can be picked up around the mazes - and pressing the Popcorn button, Pitt and Patti can throw them at the enemies, and they shall bounce off the walls until they hit one (or evaporate if they have not done so by the end of the stage). 

Killing all enemies in a maze advances the player to the next stage; however, in the event of one enemy remaining, he will make for the nearest corner of the maze, say "Bye-bye!", and disappear - which will detract from the "Pursuit Bonus" that the players will receive after they defeat Mao at the end of the game.</desc>

It features elements of tongue-in-cheek humor combined with the action. The player takes control of an enchanted ape who must battle hordes of jungle monsters with energy balls from his mouth (described humorously as "monkey-spit" or "monkey-vomit" by some gamers). The ultimate goal is to destroy the evil wizard who cast a spell on you; therefore transforming yourself from an ape back into a human, and rescuing the kidnapped princess. The game was ported to several video game consoles and home computers.</desc>

		<desc>Tokimeki Memorial Taisen Puzzle-dama is a game in the Taisen Puzzle-dama series featuring the female characters from the Konami dating-sim "Tokimeki Memorial." The game is set up as a two player versus puzzle game with CPU opponents for the single player game.

'Coins' drop in sets of two's from the top of the screen and players must form chains of three or more same colored coins to make them disappear. Clearing multiple chains at a time sends locked coins to the other side. These locked coins are enclosed in clear spheres which are removed when a nearby coin is cleared from the screen. This can set off more chains which adds to the strategy of the game.

If the coins get stacked up to the top of the screen then the player loses the game. Upon continuing the player will restart the same match.</desc>

The game play is 100% identical to the original. The only thing different is that all 32 stages have completely different arrangements of blocks. The layout of level 2 is a drawing of the US flag, with the stars represented by silver blocks. The layout of level 4 is a drawing of Chack'n from "Chack'n Pop". Chack'n's eyes are made out of indestructible gold blocks. 
The game does not appear to have been distributed anywhere else in the world but the U.S. Tournament Arkanoid was also never ported to any home system.</desc>

		<name>Tron</name>
		<desc>Tron is a 1- or 2-player game set inside the 'Tron' computer, and is based on the ground-breaking Disney movie of the same name.

Tron consists of twenty-two stages - or 'phases' - of play. Each phase consists of four separate games called "domains", all of which must be completed before moving on to the next phase. Players can determine the order in which each of the four domains is attempted, but the domain position is random and is only revealed once that domain has been chosen.

The four domains that make up a phase never change throughout the game, although both the difficulty level and number of enemies increases with each subsequent phase. The domains are as follows:

LIGHT CYCLES: The player controls a Light Cycle that leaves a blue light trail in its wake. The aim is to 'box in' the yellow enemy Light Cycles, making them crash into either a cycle trail (theirs or the player's) or a wall. The player must also avoid any collision with either walls or light trails. The joystick controls the direction of the bike and the trigger controls its speed.
I/O TOWER: Destroy the Grid Bugs that emerge from the grid surrounding the tower. The bugs will multiply and fill the entire screen if not stopped. Players must attempt to clear a path to - and enter - the I/O Tower before the timer runs out. The stick controls the movement of the player's character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.
TANK MAZE: Destroy all enemy tanks that are patrolling the maze. The player's tank can fire in all directions and can bounce shots off walls, but can be destroyed by a single shot; while enemy tanks can only fire in the direction of travel but need three shots before they are destroyed. "Recognizer" tanks also feature in later phases; these Do NOT shoot but move quickly and will try to ram the player's tank. The joystick controls the movement of the player's tank and the spinner controls the direction of fire.
MCP CONE: Destroy the blocks in the descending, rotating coloured column to clear a path and move the character up into the light cone above the blocks. A bonus is awarded if all of the blocks are destroyed. The stick controls the movement of the character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.

Bonus lives are awarded periodically throughout the game as specific point scores are reached. Each enemy and item has an assigned point value (see the "SCORING" section for details).</desc>

There are power-ups to increase ship speed, add a smartbomb to your stock, and change/strengthen your current weapon. Red fires bombs in a small area around your ship,  blue is a homing laser, and green fires wide-reaching salvos of green shots.</desc>

		<desc>Tumble Pop is a platform game for one or two players in which the aim is to clear each level of enemies by sucking them into - then ejecting them from - a portable vacuum-cleaner. 

Holding down the fire button sucks the enemies into the cleaner, releasing the button causes them to be expelled back out. Ejected enemies act as projectiles that can damage and kill any other on-screen enemies that they collide with. All enemies must be killed before players can progress to the next stage. 

Throughout the game, letters of the alphabet randomly appear in bubbles. These can be collected to eventually spell the word "TUMBLEPOP". Once this has been achieved players are transported to a time-limited bonus level, giving them the opportunity to earn bonus points and extra lives.

		<name>Twin Bee Yahhoo!</name>
		<desc>Twin Bee Yahho! differs from Detana!! TwinBee in that the player can adjust their playing style before starting the game to suit their preference. The player begins by choosing between three difficulty settings: Practice, Normal, and Special. Practice course is the game's easiest setting and lasts only three stages, whereas the Special course is the hardest setting and is recommended to expert players. The player will then select between four different charged shots. The regular Charge Shot from Detana! TwinBee is selectable, along with a Charge Punch, a Charge Split (which will cause the player's ship to shoot duplicates of itself), and a Charge Explosion that fires at eight directions at the same time. The player will then choose between two control styles: one which fires the gun with one button and drops bombs with the second, while the other style shoots and drops bomb at the same time with a single button (either button can be used).

Like in previous Twin Bee games, there are two kinds of power-ups: bell power-ups obtained from the sky and land power-ups that can be retrieved from destroy ground enemies. The bells can be changed to up to six colors this time (yellow, blue, white, green, red, and pink), each with a unique attribute. GwinBee returns as well as a power-up item, along with the twin attacks that can be performed with GwinBee or another player.</desc>

		<name>Twin Eagle - Revenge Joe's Brother</name>
		<desc>A vertical shoot-em-up that places the player's helicopter against multiple attacking targets in the air, sea, and land. Collecting the weapon and speed power-ups throughout the game is vital since the gameplay is quite difficult.

The object of the game, which is not explained further, is to avenge Joe's brother - which is probably not assumed to be the player, but presumably a friend of the player who lost his brother to the enemy. (It uses bad English grammar on the subtitle of the screen, using "revenge" as a verb, as apposed to "avenge".  That being said, it's a pretty tight game otherwise.)  To do so, you must destroy the fortress on the very last level. When you start the game and it scrolls onto the starting screen, the background contains the different levels that you must survive. The starting position of the various enemies does not vary from game to game.</desc>

		<name>Twin Hawk</name>
		<desc>Twin Hawk is a typical vertical scrolling shooter with a top-down view. Your goal is easy, shoot all the enemies along the way. You only get a standard gun on your plane, and no bombs. Instead of bombs you can call helper planes. These planes make a formation around you and help to shoot all enemies.

Along the way you get the chance to collect power-ups by shooting transport trucks. When these are destroyed they release a power-up. There are three types. First is the weapon upgrade, with this you get a wider and more powerful shot. Second, you get more calls for helper planes. And third are extra lives.

		<name>Two Tigers</name>
		<desc>Two Tigers is a 2-D shooter. The game starts by telling you how may hits you must make on the ship before you can claim credit for sinking it. You then will go to the next screen which has your fighter/bomber in the middle of the screen. A gunsight will also be somewhere in the sky (the gunsight is actually the spot where anti-aircraft fire will be hitting at). Soon the sky is filled with enemy planes and a ship enters the screen from the left side. You mission will be to do whatever it takes to put the required number of holes into the enemy ship to sink it. You have at your disposal a single bomb and the enemy planes themselves for achieving your goal. Along the way, other things may assist (if you shoot them) such as mines and fuel drums. The game will go until you fail to sink 2 ships. If you are in 2-player cooperative mode, then the number of holes to sink a ship will be increased. The same rules apply, though, for sending it to the bottom of the sea.</desc>

Police Commissioner Gordon has called on three of New York's Finest undercover cops: Bubba, an ex-professional football player; Flame, a former Miss America; and Claude, a retired philosophy teacher. They must fight every lackey and vanquish Dr. Clayborn in order to restore law and order to the city. 

Besides the usual human thugs, players fight strange mole creatures and mutants with jet packs and blades for hands. Players can never use enemy weapons, but the stages contain objects that can be picked up and used instead, These include burning oil drums, steel girders, concrete columns that shatter on impact, boxes of hand grenades and giant fish. 

As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is more powerful than standard attacks but each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's health is lost.

Player characters can eat mice, frogs, birds and snails to restore their health. The game consists of five stages with a powerful enemy boss character waiting at the end of each one.</desc>

The guardians must be defeated as quickly as possible as their energy bars will replenish in between the player's attacks.

A weapon, in the form of Nunchakas, can occasionally be found and picked-up; adding to the player's 'kick' and 'punch' fighting moves. Some of the game's many enemies are also armed, with either clubs, chains, knives or guns. The game ends once Madonna is rescued.</desc>

The standard shot weapon is a twin-shot weapon capable of strengthening in size and power with upgrades. However, the player has to tap the fire button to fire rapidly; once the button is held down, the ship charges a stronger version of the normal shot capable of spreading out across the entire screen in twelve directions. The playerâ€™s bomb weapon, the Circle Bomb, encircles the ship once activated and seeks out enemies upon an additional tap of the bomb button.

There are a total of four items for the player to pick up shot strength, circle bomb, points, and and extra life.</desc>

		<desc>A sequel to the arcade version was released the same year as a conversion kit for Gauntlet titled Vindicators Part II. Only approximately 400 units were made. There are only a few minor differences as the gameplay is nearly identical to the first, even keeping 10 of the 14 original stations of the first Vindicators. It even keeps the old graphics, music and sound. Though the in-game voice was changed to a less robotic sounding male, and several tank upgrades were added that are picked up as powerups and expire after a level is finished.</desc>

In downtown LA, a manager called Blinks is training up a new fighter called Bad Blue. He is a strong contender to become the champion and desperately needs the prize money.</desc>

		<name>Violent Storm</name>
		<desc>Violent Storm is a sideways-scrolling beat-em-up for up to three players set in the aftermath of World War III. The survivors of the war are attempting to rebuild their world but are being terrorised by violent gangs . Three vigilante heroes called 'Boris', 'Wade' and 'Kyle' are trying to protect the citizens but are hampered in their efforts by the evil and corrupt 'GELD' gang. As the heroes are patrolling the streets, they see their friend, Sheena, kidnapped by the gang. The vigilantes must fight through seven enemy-packed stages to rescue their friend and destroy the gang.

As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, but with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's health is lost. Health levels can be replenished by finding the food that lies hidden in breakable crates and barrels. 

Some of the gang members will drop a weapon when they are felled. These weapons can then be picked up and used by the players. Destructible crates and barrels also contain weapons and random bonus items. Stunned enemies fall to the ground and can still be attacked while prone.</desc>

		<desc>Virtua Fighter 2 is a fighting game developed by Sega. It is the sequel to Virtua Fighter and the second game in the Virtua Fighter series. It was created by the Sega's Yu Suzuki-headed AM2 and was released in the arcade in 1994. VF2 was known for breakthrough graphics at the time. It used Sega's Model 2 arcade hardware to run the game at 60 frames per second at a high resolution with no slowdown.

The arena size could be adjusted up to a very small platform or all the way to 82 meters, which in the genre is considered very large; this is the only game in the seriesâ€”other than Virtua Fighter Remixâ€”that could have such size adjustments. The physical energy meter could also be adjusted to infinity as well, giving you the advantage when beating opponents in the game or practicing moves against the computer player. Incidentally, players discovered that adjusting the arena to a smaller size and giving the characters infinite health could lead to mock sumo matches, wherein victory is achieved by knocking the other player out of the ring.</desc>

Virtua Fighter 3 also adds undulations in the stages - knowing how to use these to your advantage is key to winning the game (by moving to higher ground, for instance).</desc>

The player controls a helicopter launched from an aircraft carrier to bomb six factories scattered across islands on a small planetoid occupied by the Bungeling Empire (frequent villains in Broderbund games), while fending off escalating counterattacks by gun turrets, fighter jets, guided missiles, and a battleship. There is also a hidden island for the player to reload on. Failure means that the Bungeling Empire develops a war machine to take over the planet Earth. Players have to attack its infrastructure while defending the aircraft carrier which serves as home base.

Raid on Bungeling Bay was published by Broderbund for the Commodore 64 in 1984, and ported to the Famicom/NES by Hudson Soft in 1985. A conversion for the arcade-based VS. System was created based on this port, and it was distributed to arcades by Nintendo.</desc>

		<desc>You are the legendary Red Baron, flying a plane through a horizontal side-scrolling scenery set during World War I. To complete a mission, you simply need to get to the landing spot on the other side without being shot down, but you can gain extra points by destroying enemy vehicles and planes. For huge points, pick up a bomb hidden in the level (you will be warned by a sound when approaching it) and drop it on a large structure. If you fail to land on the landing strip, you run out of fuel and crash.

You can only shoot horizontally and diagonally by tilting the plane's nose. When in trouble, perform an aerial loop with the secondary button, this often destroys other planes and avoids bullets. There is a co-op mode with the character Max as well.</desc>

The player takes control of Mikey and must explore a variety of caverns and rooms, searching for the three keys needed to unlock the huge, metal door that bars progress to the next level. The keys are hidden behind a number of doors which can only be removed by placing a bomb in front of them and blowing them open. Mikey's progress is hampered by the many enemies that roam the levels. The bombs needed to blow the doors appear when certain enemies are killed.

A fellow 'Goonie' is trapped behind one of the doors on each level, and can be rescued, although this isn't necessary to progress to the next level. A catapult, or 'slingshot', can also be found, allowing Mikey to attack enemies from a safe distance.</desc>

You only have two weapons, your blaster, and a limited supply of bombs. This title uses the time honored top-down vertically scrolling format. The background moves eternally forward, but you can move all around the screen, and can make the screen scroll both left and right. Your enemies consist of an assortment of fairly realistic looking spacecraft, some of which have a distinctive 'insectoid' look to them. This game is endless and it doesn't seem to have a level format. You just move forward and shoot. The backgrounds will change from time to time from planetary surfaces to space scenes and eventually they will start repeating once you blast this particularly large alien formation.</desc>

		<name>Warlords</name>
		<desc>Atari's Warlords depicts a third-person view of four castles. The player-controlled Warlords and computer-controlled Black Knights use shields to defend their castle walls from the fireballs that ricochet around the playfield. 

Players can capture and catapult the fireballs at opposing castles, using their shield control and 'Power Stone' pushbutton. When a fireball hits a castle wall, it destroys one or more bricks, depending on its speed. 

A castle not paid for is controlled by the computer, with a Black Knight displayed in the appropriate castle. The Black Knights catapult fireballs at the players with increasing accuracy, to provide challenge. 

Game play begins when any start button is pressed and the countdown has ended. The game ends when the last Warlord's castle (containing a crown) has been penetrated by a fireball. At this point a white cloud envelopes the crown, and the latter disappears. 

During the countdown, a dragon flies back and forth across the screen with a fireball in its mouth. At the end of the countdown, a position activated by a Start button has its Black Knight changed to a Warlord's crown. A position not activated remains as a Black Knight and is controlled by the computer. The dragon then spits the fireball from its mouth toward a Warlord's castle. 

The objective is to destroy the three other castles, while protecting one's own castle with the moving shield. The LED pushbuttons have dual functions: in the Ready-to-Play mode they work as Start switches, and during game play they become 'Power Stones' to allow players to capture and catapult fireballs at opponents.

Players take on a variety of orcs, ogres, demons and other mythical creatures in their bid to destroy Satan, decapitating each enemy they encounter in order to collect their skulls for points and power-ups.

The player's character is an armor wearing beastmaster who sits atop of a fist-fighting giant.  Upon the player's command, the player may switch his mount into a tiger and attack with his mace.  Within each stage, there are also power-ups that allow the player to morph into a laser breathing dragon for a limited period of time.

The player's life bar is represented by a fire breathing dragon in the upper corner.  With each hit the player takes, the fire breath grows smaller.  Once the life bar is depleted the player's mount is killed and the player travels on foot and fights with throwing daggers.  If hit in this form then the player loses a life.  The game is over when all of a players lives are lost.</desc>

At the start of the game Wonder Boy is unarmed, but the mayor of Wonder Land (as it was known before the invasion) gives him a short sword to help him in his quest. Wonder Boy has a life meter represented as a series of red hearts and whenever he sustains damage, the hearts deplete. When all the hearts are depleted, Wonder Boy dies and the game ends. As well as the life meter, there is also an Hourglass Timer at the top of the screen; whenever this runs out, Wonder Boy loses some life. The Timer can be refilled by collecting hourglasses or by visiting hospitals or taverns.</desc>

		<desc>In this colorful shooter, the player controls a starship with two basic attacks - Twin bullets that hit airborne enemies and Drop bombs that hit ground objects indicated by the target in front of the starship. Throughout each planet, the player will find shops in which better equipment can be purchased for the ship's engines (to increase speed), missiles (for better but limited firepower), bombs (greater but limited destruction on ground targets), barriers (to protect the starship) and option (which sells mixed equipment). The credit needed for purchases is found from destroyed airborne and ground targets. The player can find letter pickups, which spell the words EXTRA, MONEY, BLAST and SECRO. If all the letters of one word are collected, the player earns a bonus that matches the word. The player loses a life if the starship is destroyed (from an enemy projectile or collision with an enemy). At the end of a planet, the player must repeatedly bomb or shoot a boss enemy to proceed to the next planet.</desc>

Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of the hapless woman whose body has been invaded by the alien queen.

The game itself is a side-scroller like R-Type, albeit with a short vertical-scrolling area towards the end of the sixth level. Instead of the Force pod, however, the main power-up apparatus takes the form of two flexible tentacles. The tentacles are invulnerable to all enemy attacks, and can be positioned with careful maneuvering of the X-002.</desc>

Now the Xevions want Earth back -- minus humans! Their invasion forces are fierce -- the land is crawling with deadly Domogram Rovers; the sky is black with Toroid Patrol Fleets and Zoshi Death Squads.

Our puny weapons offer no defense. Earth's only hope is our powerful new Solvalou Fighter Plane. Its pilot will have a single mission: Penetrate the enemy ranks and destroy the Xevious Mother Ship.

The mission is dangerous. We can't guarantee success. But at this point, it's do or die!

One small problem. We still need a pilot. Any volunteers?</desc>

		<name>Xexex</name>
		<desc>Xexex is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which players pilot a ship called the 'Flintlock' and must save the blue-haired Princess Irene of the planet E-Square from an evil lord named Klaus. 

The player's ship has a detachable orb attachment called the Flint, which behaves in a similar fashion to the 'Force Device' from Irem's "R-Type" series. Power-ups can be obtained to increase the Flint's power, movement speed, change the main weapon, or even give the player an extra life.

The player starts the game armed with the Proton Laser, which emits thin stream of weak bullets. Defeating certain enemies will drop other weapons:
Homing Laser: A 3-way laser with weak "bending" homing for top and bottom lasers.
Shadow Laser: A laser beam that creates a damage-inflicting shadow as the ship moves up and down. 
Round Laser: An unusual spread shot (different from the overseas version's main weapon)
Spiral Laser: A spiral laser of considerable width.
Search Laser: A laser with strong homing that travels in square trajectories.
Ground Laser: Fires an upgraded Proton Laser along with a laser beam that travels along the ground.

The name of the current weapon is displayed at the bottom of the screen. In the non-Japanese overseas versions, the only available weapon is the Proton Laser and picking up power-ups simply increases the spread of the weapon. Missiles are a secondary weapon.</desc>

A large bird replaces the UFO that goes over the top of the screen from time to time. While a lumberjack will chop out a section of the tree every time the birds reach the side of the screen (lowering them closer to the bottom). The only real gameplay difference is that the birds come in a pyramid pattern, as opposed to the rectangle pattern of "Space Invaders". This serves to make the game much easier.</desc>

It enjoyed a degree of success in arcades and was subsequently ported to the Mega Drive by Toaplan on May 31, 1991, in Japan, and by Sega during the following year in Europe, followed by a Japan-only release by Naxat Soft on September 18, 1992, for the PC Engine's CD-ROM².

The European version of the Mega Drive port was the source for "All your base are belong to us", an Internet meme which plays off the poorly translated English in the game's introduction.

Set in 2101, the game follows the signing of a peace treaty between the United Nations and CATS, an alien cyborg. However, CATS breaks the covenant and takes control of the Japanese space colonies. The protagonist leads the ZIG spacecraft, managed to escape from the mother ship destroyed by CATS, with the aim to defeat enemy forces and liberate the Earth.

As with other scrolling shooters, the aim of the game is to shoot all enemies that appear on screen and avoid getting obliterated by enemy fire, crashing into enemies or into foreground scenery. There are mid-level and end-of-level boss enemies that stay with the player until they are defeated. The game features eight levels.</desc>

		<desc>ZnY is basically Parodius meets Space Invaders (a premise also done by Taito themselves with Space Invaders '95: Attack of the Lunar Loonies), except you control a statue instead of a spaceship and you fight within an enclosed arena instead of vertical space. It would be more akin to an arena shooter like Robotron: 2084, except your statue can only shoot straight upward. The stages themselves all seem to be themed around different parts of the world: The kabuki boss on the far-left represents Japan, the chef represents China and mainland Asia, the crusader knight stands for Europe, and the superhero on the far-right stands for America. Yet even outside of the Japanese stages, there's a distinctly goofy flair about the game that emphasizes screwy cultural stereotypes from a Japanese game company. The game's actual developer, Minato Giken, also helped work on the Game Gear version of Dynamite Headdy, one of the most fantastically insane Genesis platformers ever, and that same sort of unhinged design can also be seen in ZnY. You fight talk show hosts, salarymen, pandas, matadors, clowns, rock stars, and other outlandish opponents detailed in exaggeratedly comical fashions. The graphic design is definitely ZnY's strong suit, with its colorful characters and quite detailed playfields making high use of Sega's System C-2 hardware, the same processor behind Puyo Puyo.</desc>

The Sword can be used to stab, or it can be spun around the player. The Shield, which can be wielded in the same manner, provides protection. Spells include Bouncing Boots, Shooting Swords, Invisibility Potions, Magic flutes, and a Dragons Egg, which put Leapin Fungoes to sleep and allows safe passage through the Dragon's Lair.</desc>

		<desc>The mystical sword of the legends, the "Soul Edge", ended up in the hands of the dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon of Spain. For the next 25 years he stayed dormant on the remnants of a Spanish port town, taking the souls of those who reached him during their search of the sword. His reign of terror was soon to start, but through the joined efforts of Greek divine warrior Sophitia Alexandra and Japanese kunoichi Taki, he was stopped and killed, with one of the twin Soul Edge blades being shattered in the process. As it was about to tear itself apart, young Prussian knight Siegfried Schtauffen approached the port town and battled Cervantes, whose corpse had been momentarily reanimated through Soul Edge's will. After emerging victorious, Siegfried's attention turned unto the sword. The moment he took the hilt of the cursed blade, Soul Edge released a bright column of light into the sky. This was known as the "Evil Seed", bound to bring calamity and death in its wake.

Three years after those events, Soul Edge uses Siegfried as its host, and now Siegfried is Nightmare, a knight wearing azure armor and sporting a hideously deformed right arm. Europe plunges into a vortex of slaughters as he and his followers claim souls to strengthen the blade in its weakened state. Unknown to them, a group of warriors met on their journey to stop Soul Edge, and with them three sacred weapons join once again.</desc>

		<desc>In this vaguely Tetris-like game, players score points by eliminating "star blocks." A star block is a colored rectangle with a star on one end of it, and blocks are eliminated when the stars of two like-colored blocks touch each other. While the game is being played, star blocks and obstacles rise from the bottom of the screen while the player moves and rotates a cursor which determines where additional star blocks will be thrown into play from off-screen. The game features single-player and competitive play as well as a story mode featuring boss creatures and a bizarre plot -- apparently the whole game is actually a sport in which children poke a creature known as a star pig with sticks in order to make it vomit star blocks.</desc>

		<name>Mortal Kombat 2</name>
		<desc>Mortal Kombat II is a direct sequel to the 1992 original featuring new fighters (increasing the character roster from 7 to 12) and improved graphics. 

As with its predecessor, MKII's matches are divided into rounds, with victory awarded to the first player to win two rounds. At the point of defeat, the losing fighter will become dazed and the winner is given the opportunity to execute a 'finishing move'. 

Some of the standard fighting moves (moves shared by all characters) have now been expanded or enhanced. A crouching punch has been added and the 'roundhouse kick' is more powerful and now knocks opponents across the screen. Also, the difference in hit boxes between high and low kicks is now more marked. 

Additionally, returning characters gain new special moves and MKII marks the first appearence of multiple Fatalities - as well as additional, non-lethal finishing moves - in the series. In addition to the Fatalities of its predecessor, MKII offers 'Babalities' (turning a defeated opponent into a crying baby), 'Friendships' (a non-malicious interaction, such as dancing or giving a gift to the defeated opponent) and stage-specific Fatalities (the winner uppercutting their opponent into an abyss below, spikes above, or a pool of acid in the background). 

Each character still shares generic attributes - speed, power, jump height and airtime - albeit with differing hit boxes. The sequel drops the points system of its prequel in favour of a consecutive win tally.</desc>

		<desc>M.I.A. - Missing in Action © 1989 Konami.

M.I.A. Missing in Action is a horizontally-scrolling run &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; gun platform game for one or two players in which Special Forces soldiers must penetrate enemy-packed combat zones to reach a POW compound and rescue captured prisoners. The rescued POWs must then be escorted safely through a final enemy-packed stage to the helicopter that awaits at the end. 

Players begin each stage armed with only a combat knife to protect them, but other weapons can be picked up from fallen enemy troops. The weapons are always carried by soldiers in red uniforms and range from an assault rifle, grenades, a flame-thrower and a bazooka. Players can carry more than one weapon and can cycle through them as needed. Each collected weapon has only a limited supply of shots.

The game&amp;#039;s first four stages are presented in random order and may also be "mirrored", switching the action from from right-to-left instead of left-to-right, increasing the game&amp;#039;s variety and adding replay value. The &amp;#039;POW&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Helicopter&amp;#039; stages are always the last two stages, however. 

At the end of each stage players must fight off a wave of enemy troops as well as destroy gun emplacements and watch towers. Certain sections of each stage offer players a different route, with both platforms and underground tunnels that can be utilized and explored. At least one POW must be safely escorted to the rescue Chopper to complete the final mission, after which the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty.

The game consists of six stages:
War-torn battlefield
Airstrip
Jungle
Rail Yard
POW Base
Escort the POWs to the Helicopter

M.I.A. Missing in Action is the direct sequel to 1985&amp;#039;s "Green Beret" but unlike its prequel, two-player games now have both players fighting side-by-side, rather than the alternating approach of the original game.</desc>

		<desc>Track &amp;amp; Field © 1983 Konami.

Track &amp;amp; Field is an athletics-themed action game for up to four players, who compete against each other in six track and field-based disciplines. 

The game controls consist of two run buttons (one for each &amp;#039;leg&amp;#039; of the athlete) and one &amp;#039;Action&amp;#039; button. Players must hit the two run buttons alternately to build up speed and use action button to jump or throw.

In each event, there is a qualifying time or minimum score threshold that the player must achieve to advance to the next event. failing to qualify (in one heat for track events or in three attempts in the other events) will reduce the players&amp;#039; number of lives by one, the game is over once all lives are lost.

Track &amp;amp; Field can accommodate up to four players, who compete in pairs in the running events and individually in the others. If there are fewer than four players, the remaining slots are played by the computer (or player "CPU"). In all multiplayer heats, however, the relative performance of the players has no effect on the game and advancing is based solely on reaching qualifying times and targets.

The six events are:

100M DASH - Run as fast as possible.
LONG JUMP - Run to the take-off board then choose angle of jump (42 is the optimum angle).
JAVELIN - Run to the line then choose angle of throw (43 is the optimum angle).
110M HURDLES - Run and time jumps over the hurdles.
HAMMER THROW - As the athlete spins faster and faster, time release of hammer and angle of throw (45 is the optimum angle).
HIGH JUMP - The athlete will run to the bar; just as he reaches it, use Action button to start the jump and hold down the action button to reduce the angle of climb, i.e. you start going straight up at 90 degrees if you tap the button just once. Use run buttons while in the air to gain extra height.</desc>

It pits 8 fighters of different styles and strengths against each other in a tournament to see who's the toughest mofo on the streets of Tokyo. Your objective as usual is to deplete your opponent's health bar within the time limit by using your basic attacks and special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) while avoiding his moves and attacks.

Unique to Aggressors of Dark Kombat is the combination of traditional side-scrolling beat 'em up elements, meaning characters can freely move in an isometric space instead of being restricted to a single plane of movement. Weapons and throw-able items are usually thrown into the arena by the crowds and you can pick them up and wield them for added damage. Additionally, matches are 1-round only affairs, with an extended multi-layered health bar that allows for longer rounds than usual.</desc>

Many of the problems that existed in the first game have been fixed in this installment (it is easier to execute special moves, you no longer have only Ryo or Robert to choose from in 1 player mode, etc.).

The entire cast from the first Art of Fighting is here (with the exceptions of Todo and Mr. Karate), along with a few new characters: Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo and Yuri's father; Yuri Sakazaki, Takuma's daughter and Ryo's sister; Eiji Kisaragi, a sworn enemy of the Sakazakis; Temjin, a Mongolian trucker; and a younger version of Geese Howard, whom you face as the last boss if you beat the game without losing a round.</desc>

		<name>Art of Fighting 3 - The Path of the Warrior</name>
		<desc>In this third and final entry in the Art of Fighting series, the story shifts from Ryo Sakazaki to his best friend and rival, Robert Garcia, as he ventures into Mexico to try and locate Freia Lawrence, a childhood friend, who asked for his help. However, he leaves without the consent of The Garcia Foundation, which sends an agent named Karman Cole to get him back. But not everything is as simple as it looks... because Robert is not the only one looking for Freia.

Art of Fighting 3: The Path of The Warrior features ten playable characters with different fighting styles, a completely new fighting system based on joystick and button combinations, and incredibly detailed graphics and animation.

This game is called 'Berabow Man' by Namco though this is likely a mistranslation as the later NEC PC-Engine port is called 'Bravoman'. The name 'BERABOW' appears in the default high score list.

In Stage 8, the main character from "Pistol-Shogun - Pistol Daimyo no Bouken" (which was released 2 years later) must be fought.

Bravoman did a cameo appearance in Namco x Capcom released for the Sony PS2 in 2005.</desc>

		<desc>The planet of Raguy was once beautiful and peaceful, but all hell broke loose when it was invaded by the Daruma tribe. The pollution started to spread through the city. Blue was summoned to get rid of the Daruma tribe, and save Raguy from the Daruma Empire that has turned the inhabitants into slaves.

You control Blue, who only has one weapon to deal with the Darumas. You can use his leaf to whip enemies upside-down, and hurl these enemies at others. Along the way, you can get flowers for use at the shop to buy items that will help you along the way. These items include flower honey (increases stamina), swim fins (easier swimming), light safe (protects all your items), spikes, and ocarinas. Later in the game, you can also get the shopkeeper to sing you a song. This helps you break curses that are placed on you by a witch.You will also interact with other characters along the way that can also help you if you tell the truth.

You exit each stage by jumping on a huge plant. The higher up you are on this plant, the more points you are awarded. Every two or so stages, you have to defeat a boss before a guy in a devil suit offers you something. You can refuse or accept the other. If you accept the offer, you will have to pull one of four strings that will give you a life ball, more stamina, 30 flowers, cocoons, or five flowers.

You are on a time limit. If you run out of time, a black creature appears out of nowhere, and starts firing "bird" missiles at you.</desc>

		<name>Double Dragon</name>
		<desc>Double Dragon is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players, featuring twin brothers and martial arts masters, "Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee". The brothers must defeat the savage street gang known as the 'Black Warriors' to rescue Billy's kidnapped girlfriend, Marian. Standing between the brothers and Marian are four huge, colorful and varied levels; each populated with a wide variety of thugs.

Many of the game's enemies carry weapons (knives, baseball bats etc.) and should Billy or Jimmy manage to knock the weapons from the enemies' hands, the heroes can pick the weapons up and use them against the enemies.

The Black Warriors is made up of six distinct enemy characters- plus Willy, the game's final boss - with each differing in both physical appearance and fighting style. The members of the Black Warriors consist of the following fighters: 
Williams - A street punk in a tank top. In addition to the standard punches and jump kicks, his signature technique is a body blow to the stomach. He also wields weapons such as baseball bats, knives and dynamite sticks.
Rowper - A punk who wears matching-colored pants and shirtless vest. He wields all the same weapons as Williams, but can also lift and throw heavy objects such as oildrums, boxes and stones.
Linda - Female punk who usually carries a whip. She's not very strong, as she falls down to ground with a couple of punches or a single kick (because of this, she is the only regular-sized enemy who cannot be placed on a headlock).
Abobo - A tall, big-muscled bald guy. His attacks includes punches, a standing kick and a body toss. He can also lift and throw heavy objects like Rowper. Due to his large size, he cannot be put into a headlock.
Boss 1 - The first boss, a head-swap of Abobo with a Mr. T-style mohawk and beard. Fights just like Abobo, only with an added double-handed slap. Unlike Abobo, he does not use weapons. A green version of him appears as the Mission 3 boss.
Boss 2 - The second boss. A head swap of the player who uses almost all the same techniques. 
Willy - The game's final boss, armed, somewhat unfairly, with a machine-gun.

Double Dragon was a huge success due to the many game-play innovations it brought to the genre (see TRIVIA for details), but it demonstrates its final moment of inspired genius at the very end of the game. Should both players still be alive after the final boss has been defeated, they will then have to fight each OTHER. The winner of this fight will be the one who wins Marian's affections.</desc>

		<desc>"Kabuki Klash" is a 2D fighting game that features characters from the famous Japanese role-playing series  Tengai Makyou, also known as Far East of Eden. The heroes of the three first Tengai Makyou games must participate in a tournament and find out who is the most skillful fighter in the magical land of Jipang (which is very similar to the medieval Japan). The characters include well-known Far East of Eden heroes such as Ziria, Manjimaru, Kabuki, Orochimaru, and others - a total of eight playable characters. During the fights, you can either punch, kick, or use special attacks, that require a precise usage of buttons and also deplete your magic gauge. There are random items (such as healing potions) thrown on the battle field while you are fighting, which you can pick up.

		<desc>The country is struggling under the cruel domination of its evil King. The rebel guerilla leader and his comrades attempt to secretly land on shore. The King's military is waiting for them, however, and the players must fight their way inland to reach and destroy the King's palace stronghold.

In this, the pseudo-sequel to SNK's own superb "Ikari Warriors" (released two years earlier), players must once again shoot their way through a number of vertically scrolling levels, all packed with large numbers of enemy soldiers, gun emplacements and vehicles. Each level also contains a number of captured prisoners tied to wooden stakes, and these can be rescued for extra points. 

The players' weapons have only a limited amount of ammunition and additional ammo/grenades must be picked up along the way. A number of gun upgrades can also be found. At various points in the game, players can also enter unoccupied enemy tanks, which provide increased firepower as well as resistance to enemy shots. Too many enemy hits, however, will eventually see the tank explode - this is proceeded by a warning flash to allow the player to exit the tank before the explosion occurs. Should the player be caught inside or near the tank when it explodes, a life is lost.

As with "Ikari Warriors", Guerrilla War features full 360 degree gameplay with attacking troops appearing from all directions. The players' on-screen counterparts are able to rotate themselves accordingly.</desc>

Instead of bubbles, MPE players (most of whom are presented as schoolchildren in pastel-colored fantasy costumes) stack coins that combine to make higher denominations--five 1 coins will turn into a single 5, two 5's become a 10, five 10's turn into 50 and so forth, on up to 500 (two of those will disappear completely). One-player games offer either solo endurance rounds or matches against a ladder of CPU opponents, but as with MD, it's the two-player mode that makes the game the most fun.</desc>

Like many other golf games, you use an accurate click type of play, where you click in an overhead map where you want to hit the ball, then adjust hook, slice, and power. In Versus mode, you can earn "super-clubs" that can only be used once. These can also be traded between friends.</desc>

		<desc>Puzzle Bobble is an arcade puzzle game offering either one or two-player competitive play, in which the aim is to clear each play area of the coloured bubbles clustered in the upper half of the screen.
This is achieved by firing bubbles up the screen - with the angle of trajectory dictated by the player - at the clusters of bubbles. The aim is to forms chains of like-coloured bubbles, making them disappear. At regular intervals the 'ceiling' of the play area - together with any bubbles stuck to it - will drop one row down the screen, decreasing the size of the play area making life more difficult for players. The game is over when the bubbles reach the very bottom of the play area.</desc>

Open up a space, and your balloon (shark-shaped if you're the boy) floats to the top, and it's on to the next floor in the tower. Sound easy? It is... at first. The tower is divided into multiple floors, with 10 stages (puzzles) per floor. There are over 50 puzzles here and the action gets pretty furious.</desc>

		<name>Real Bout Fatal Fury 2 - The Newcomers</name>
		<desc>SNK's Fatal Fury fighting series reaches its 7th episode bringing a lot of "innovations" and some significant changes, starting from characters: all the 20 fighters from previous game return with new artworks and battle stages completely redrawn, as well as some remodeled (or new) moves.

The traditional fighting system comes with sensible modifications, like the removal of both "Rank System" (SSS, SS, S, AAA etc.) and ground breakable objects. The match system using 2 battle plans (foreground/background) remains semi-intact, because now some battle fields (like Cheng Sinzan's stage) uses a single plane, forcing the players to use only the basic defense to avoid attacks.

But the main addition of this title (and the reason for subtitle "The Newcomers") are 2 new characters entering for Fatal Fury's main cast: Rick Strowd, a mysterious fighter with a particular fighting style and Li Xiangfei, a young female Chinese martial arts fighter.

Vowing never to spill innocent blood again, he targets those who live by the way of the sword...but now the hunter becomes the hunted.

The "Slash" techniques are the original moves of the most of the characters whereas the "Bust" techniques maybe the "darker" version of each character.</desc>

In spite of these little improvements, the game preserved (and improved a lot) many elements that did the previous one (Samurai Shodown III: Blades of Blood) a quite popular title, like the dodge move and the chance to choose between two versions of the fighter: the standard one and an alternative dark-styled one (SLASH and BUST, respectively).

With the intention to provide more action in the battles, the "No Contest" Moves were introduced: working in similar way (and under certain conditions) to the many games of Mortal Kombat Series, your fighter will execute an ultimate-slaughter move in a stunned opponent.

		<name>Samurai Shodown V</name>
		<desc>Seven years after the fourth game in the series, Samurai Shodown returns. In the game's time frame, this is the earliest game, hence the Japanese title Samurai Spirits Zero. It takes place in 1786 from January through the later summer. The game is therefore considered a prequel to the series.

The overall gameplay was slightly altered. It is a little faster, and the Slash/Bust system has been removed. Each character now has only one version, or the Bust mode is simply replaced by a new character of very similar setup. Combo slashes, sidestepping and fatalities have also vanished. The basic moves have been modeled after the first games in the series. They consist of three types of slashes, a single kick, and various dodge maneuvers similar to Samurai Shodown II.

There are 24 characters, a familiar cast with some new faces. Unlike the previous games, it is not possible to kill your opponent.</desc>

The game features 2 different horizontal planes to which the characters can freely jump to in order to avoid attacks a la Fatal Fury. You cannot escape completely however, as all characters have a throwing weapon they can use in different ways to reach each other no matter where they are.</desc>

Unfortunately for them they also get caught in a time-warping scheme caused by the evil Nobunaga who attempts to invade the time period with mythical warriors and evil creatures from the Japanese sengoku period.

The game thus takes you from the city to a spirit-realm from time to time, in which you must fight all sorts of Japanese mythical figures, and release three haunted spirits that can aid you in your battle. Collecting orbs from defeated enemies allows you heal up, gain weapons and even energy attacks and also summon the warrior forms of the spirits you released, which change your character's form and give you a new collection of attacks and powers.</desc>

As in the original, the game plays as a standard 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up, in which you have to proceed through each stage killing all enemies that cross your path and defeating the stage boss to proceed. New for the sequel is the inclusion of swords as your default weapons, which now feature both high and low attacks, as well as a block move that allows you to parry enemy attacks. Collecting orbs gives you weapon upgrades and energy attacks, as well as the ability to morph into any of the three spirits released in the original which give you a new arsenal of moves and powers.</desc>

The game incorporates a more complex fighting system similar to a one-on-one fighting game, by giving players different attack buttons, special moves based on directional inputs, combos and even a super bar used to unleash devastating super moves. You cannot change weapons or transform into other characters as in the previous games, but you can acquire different ranged weapons for additional attacks as well as unlock certain bosses to increase your available characters.</desc>

By using quarter-circle movement, you can also add effect to the throw. To catch difficult discs, you can slide to move more quickly. There are six characters to choose from, with specific abilities and their own court fit for their skills. A single game consists of short sets of thirty seconds.

		<name>1942</name>
		<desc>"1942" is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in the Pacific theatre during World War II, in which the goal is to reach Tokyo and destroy the entire Japanese air fleet. 

The player pilots a plane dubbed the "Super Ace" (its appearance is that of a Lockheed P-38 Lightning) and has to shoot down waves of enemy planes while avoiding incoming enemy fire. The 'Super Ace' can perform a limited number of rolls or 'loop-the-loops' to evade enemy planes and shots. 

During the game, waves of red enemy planes periodically appear. If the player manages to destroy a red wave, a power-up, in the form of a 'POW' symbol, will be dropped and can be picked up. The power-up will award either increased fire-power (doubling the player's guns from two to four), a smart bomb that destroys all on-screen enemy planes the instant it's collected, two wingmen planes that flank the Super Ace and increase fire power, or simply extra points.

At the end of each stage the 'Super Ace' lands on an aircraft carrier and bonus points are awarded based on player performance. "1942" differs from other games in that its levels are numbered in reverse order, so the game begins at stage 32 and ends at stage 1.</desc>

		<name>Street Fighter III : New Generation</name>
		<desc>A New Generation of Street Fighters! Features larger characters sprites than previous Street Fighter games with the smoothest, most detailed 2-D animation ever made at the time of its release, a level of quality that is yet to be matched by any other 2-D game outside of the Street Fighter III series as of 2004; some complain that too many things are animated and each animation contains too many frames, slowing down the pace of the game.</desc>

		<name>X-Men</name>
		<desc>X-Men is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for up to four players. The X-Men's mission is to find and rescue Professor X, who has been captured by evil mutants and is now being held prisoner by Magneto.

Each X-Man character has an 'Attack', 'Jump' and 'Mutant Power' button. The mutant power attack is a powerful special move unique to each X-Man. While it inflicts a lot of damage on the enemies, the trade-off is that each usage removes 3 bars from the players health meter (a full meter has 10 bars). Each level ends with a face-off against a powerful mutant boss character.

The game has six stages, with the final one set on 'Asteroid M', Magneto's base. The defeated mutant bosses from the previous levels each make an appearance (albeit in a less powerful form) before the final encounter with Magneto himself.

Players can chose from 6 X-Men characters, they are:
Cyclops 
Colossus 
Wolverine 
Storm 
Nightcrawler 
Dazzler</desc>

		<name>Sunset Riders</name>
		<desc>Sunset Riders is a horizontally-scrolling platform shoot-em-up for up to four players set in America's Wild West. Four sharpshooter bounty hunters (Steve, Billy, Bob and Cormano) set out to claim the bounties for killing the most wanted outlaws in the West, before a final showdown against the infamous Sir Richard de la Rose.

The action takes place both on foot and on horseback, with play sometimes broken up with a wild west pursuit; such as having to run along the backs of a herd of fleeing Buffalo. Each level ends with players entering a one-on-one battle against one of the wanted men they have been pursuing. 

Power-ups and bonus items can be obtained by entering saloons or defeating certain sack-carrying bandits. The power-ups comes in the form of either a golden sheriff badge (that gives the player's weapon auto-fire) or a silver badge that gives the player a second gun (making it possible to shoot in two directions simultaneously). Both power-ups can be equipped at the same time. 

Other weapons that can be used by players include sticks of dynamite carried by female bandits that can be thrown back at the enemy before they explode and a mounted Gatling gun available only in the last stage. 

A bonus mini-game appears at the end of Stages 2 and 5 in which players must shoot at enemies from a first-person perspective before the timer runs out.

Sunset Riders features eight stages of play.</desc>

		<name>The Simpsons</name>
		<desc>A jewel heist gone wrong sees Mr Burns's sidekick, Smithers, kidnapping Maggie and making his escape. Between one and four players take on the role of either Homer, Marge, Lisa, or Bart in this colorful, horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up from Konami. Each Simpsons character possesses an attacking move specific to them; Marge is armed with a vacuum cleaner, Lisa has a skipping rope, Bart has his skateboard, and Homer fights with his fists. The players must battle their way through a variety of Simpsons-themed levels - such as Springfield and Krustyland - fighting goons, thugs, zombies, drunks, firemen, and several Simpsons regulars. Many Simpsons characters that don't appear as enemies have 'cameo' scenes in the game (Otto working at a burgerstand in Krustyland, for example). The archetypal 'boss' character awaits the players at the end of every stage. The game ends with a final showdown with the evil Mr. Burns in his luxurious mansion.

The Simpsons was designed to Konami's typically-high production standards and was, like the 'Ninja Turtles' games that appeared a couple of years' earlier, very faithful to its source material. The colorful, smoothly-animated sprites captured the spirit of the legendary cartoon superbly, and the game's many humorous touches were timed to perfection.</desc>

		<name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time</name>
		<desc>The sequel to 1989's hugely successful original, 'Turtles in Time' once more sees the four heroes taking on Shredder and his army. Gameplay remains similar to the original game, but the experience is enhanced further with the obligatory improved graphics and sound effects. 'Turtles in Time' also features a larger variety of levels, as now the battle between good and evil rages across time as the Turtles travel to prehistoric, pirate and Wild West times in their pursuit of the elusive Splinter. 

Yet again, Konami's mastery of the genre was in evidence as the manic energy and humour of the cartoon and comic-book series upon which the game is based was captured perfectly.</desc>

		<desc>The goal is to shoot down enemy airplanes and collect weapon power-ups (POW). One is only able to perform three loops per level and a bonus is awarded at the end of the level for unused loops. Player 1 uses a P-38 Lightning and Player 2 uses a Mosquito Mk IV. The game shifts from the original Pacific Front setting with that of the Western Front.

The game consists of six levels.

It was the first shoot 'em up to add +1 to the score when a continue is used.[1]</desc>

		<name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</name>
		<desc>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a side-scrolling beat 'em up released by Konami in 1989. It is based on the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series which began airing in the winter of 1987. The player chooses from one of the four Ninja Turtles: Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael. After Shredder kidnaps the Turtles' friend April O'Neil and their mentor Splinter, they must give chase, save their comrades, and defeat the evil Shredder. Up to four players (two in some versions) can take control of any of the Turtles. Donatello has slower attacks but a longer range, Michelangelo and Raphael have faster attacks but a shorter range, and Leonardo is a well-rounded Turtle with average range and speed. Most of the enemies the Turtles face are the Foot Soldiers, all color-coded to indicate their attack patterns and weapon of choices. Some enemies, such as the standard purple-clad Foot Soldiers and Roadkill Rodney robots, have the ability to restrain the Turtles' mobility and drain their health, leaving the player open to attack for other enemies. The bosses in the game include Rocksteady and Bebop (individually at first in that order, and later the two of them together), Baxter Stockman, Granitor, General Traag, Krang, and Shredder himself.</desc>
