		<desc>Crazy Taxi is an open world racing video game.

The main objective of the game is to pick up customers and take them to their chosen destination as quickly as possible. Along the way, money can be earned by performing stunts such as near misses with other vehicles. The player is directed to a destination by a large green arrow at the top of the screen. The arrow does not adjust based on obstacles, but rather points in the general direction of the destination. Once the player arrives near the destination, they must stop within a specified zone. When the destination is reached, that customer's fare is added to the player's total money earned. Ratings are then awarded depending on how long the player took to complete the journey. If the customer's timer runs out before the player reaches the destination the customer jumps from the taxi.</desc>

		<name>Monkey Ball</name>
		<desc>Monkey Ball is a Sega NAOMI GD-ROM arcade game, originally released in 2001. It is the first game in the Super Monkey Ball series.

The arcade cabinet of Monkey Ball is unique for its banana-shaped joystick. All the bananas in the game are sponsored by Dole, a practise that would carry through to its successor, Super Monkey Ball and Super Monkey Ball 2. There are three characters, AiAi, MeeMee and Baby, three difficulty levels and numerous puzzles to complete.

Monkey Ball was somewhat unique at the time of release. Though marble/ball rolling games had been done in the past, such as Marble Madness, these types of games are fairly rare, and none had ever been presented in 3D.

Monkey Ball itself was not ported to consoles. Instead, an upgraded version titled Super Monkey Ball was released for the GameCube a few years later. It contains all the levels seen in Monkey Ball, plus enhanced graphics and extra features.</desc>

It's a music game based around good timing and rhythm. The game has music supplied by the record production company J.P. ROOM, and is developed by the team responsible for Wario Ware, which is visible in the quirky presentation of the game.

The game is actually a series of shorter games bundled into one package. Control is normally very simple - usually, only the A Button is required, but some games make players press multiple buttons for different actions.

Players will punch in time with a karate expert as pots and rocks are thrown; pluck hairs off of an onion; march in time to an instructor; hit a baseball while the screen zooms in and out; shoot ghosts with arrows; chop demons as a samurai; and much more.</desc>

		<desc>Virtua NBA presents its basketball action on a 3D court, but it essentially maintains a 2D perspective for most of the viewing, save for its replay sequences. Essentially, it looks like a highly detailed 3D version of NBA Showtime. Because Sega opted to allow only five preselected characters per team, it could focus on making sure those players look very life-like (rather than attempt to bring every NBA player into the game). The players all animate well, and their shadows and reflections look very slick. Other than that, the crowd looks more realistic than any I've ever seen before - go up for a shot and people will actually look up at you. Very well done.</desc>

		<desc>Virtua Striker 2 is a football game. Players compete as 1 of 32 international teams, detailed down to the members' uniforms and playing styles. As the most dedicated soccer fanatic expects, the gameplay is highly detailed and the action is fast and furious. The realistic, motion-captured players perform a plethora of stylish moves, including bicycle kicks, headers, and slide tackles. One cool feature: as the virtual clock ticks away the hours from morning through evening, the environmental lighting adjusts accordingly. Of course, a social game like soccer is twice as fun with a fellow Pelé wannabe, which is why there's a head-to-head two-person multiplayer mode.</desc>

The main purpose is to make it to the finish line with your cargo within a given time. Players choose one of several trucks, each rated in speed, handling, etc. They then race from point to point across the country, hauling cargo (more difficult cargo will increase your pay for that leg of the journey) while avoiding innocent traffic (blare the horn to get drivers out of your way) and trying to outrun a reckless computer opponent (or player two in linked matches). Good performances are rewarded with bonus stages that require players to maneuver the truck in tight alleyways and park the truck in a limited amount of time.</desc>

		<name>Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001</name>
		<desc>Capcom vs. SNK 2 combines characters and gameplay elements from various Capcom and SNK fighting games, mainly the Street Fighter and The King of Fighters seriesthough elements are also borrowed from the Fatal Fury and Samurai Shodown series.

In contrast to the original Capcom vs. SNK, characters no longer have a specific "Ratio." Instead the player can select up to three characters in a team and give an amount or ratio (up to four) to each as desired. In console versions of the game, players can also choose a 1-on-1 game or a 3-on-3 game in arcade mode with the ratio system removed.

Unlike the first game, which was based on the King of Fighters-style two-strength, four button system of punches and kicks, Capcom vs. SNK 2 is based on the three strength, six-button system of punches and kicks, native to the Street Fighter series, with the SNK characters being tweaked to fit the 6-button style. The overall system is derivative of Street Fighter Alpha, however, a number of different fighting styles called "grooves", which mimic other Capcom and SNK games, are included in the engine. These dictate both the character's Super Gauge system, and special techniques, such as dashes, running, and guard cancels, called "Subsystems".

There are six grooves in total, each designtated with a letter, along with custom grooves that can be programmed in home versions of the game. Each player designates prior to the match which groove his or her team will use.</desc>

		<desc>Sega makes the one of the best baseball arcade systems ever with the 1999 version of the classic World Series Baseball. Everything that is needed in a good arcade is here, it's quick, easy to learn, and most of all you get your money's worth when you play. The game is pretty basic with a normal game mode that can be played 1 on 1 or 1 vs. comp. For your first credit you get 3 innings of offence and defence and from there can put in more money to continue.</desc>

		<name>Chaos Field</name>
		<desc>Do you love battling the boss ships that appear at the end of each level of your favorite shmup? How about a game where you battle nothing BUT bosses? Your wish is granted with Chaos Field!!

The game draws on elements from other shooters to create its own unique hybrid style of play. You'll have a lock-on feature to take enemies and certain bullets out, as well as a "Radiant Silvergun"-style short-range energy field that will absorb certain bullets.

The action plays out in top-down fashion in the time-honored traditions of the shooting genre. Enemies and bullets will swarm like bees to honey, and it will be up to you to destroy everything, while avoiding getting blown up.</desc>

To defeat them, the player can use a regular rapid-fire shot, a more concentrated "rolling shot", or a limited supply of screen-clearing bombs. At the beginning of the game the player can choose between two characters, Kei and Yuhei. Kei plays in a more traditional manner, using a wide shot and normal bomb, while Yuhei has a narrow shot and a bomb which increases the player's Buzz radius.</desc>

		<desc>Shooting Love 2007 is a compilation of two shooters:

Exzeal:
Exzeal follows the similar formula to "Trizeal" in which players progress through the stages and destroy the bosses respectively. However, the weapon power-up system from Trizeal was removed, replaced by the special fixed-weapon system, with a standard attack and a charged attack that can destroy single large enemies once. The player can choose from one of the four weapon sets during the start, with one mimicking the attack pattern of "XII Stag".

Shmups Skill Test:
A collection of competitive mini-games for shooter fans. A player's proficiency is measured at the end of each mini-game, with both 'Score' and 'Result' displayed, and there are 3 modes in proficiency measurement.</desc>

Each stage has a range of military themed enemies, including tanks, gunships and other helicopters, as well as an end of level boss. To encourage risky play for high reward, bosses are harder and yield more points when a player has fewer lives left. Once the player has completed the five stages, the game starts a second loop on stage 2-1, a mirrored version of stage 1-1 with an increased difficulty level and altered background. Once stage 2-5 has been completed, the game is over.</desc>
