		<desc>BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge is an ura- or gaiden-version of Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Satellaview system featuring graphical enhancements similar to its Super Mario All-Stars version. While the underlying gameplay itself is largely similar, some content has been rearranged and new content has been added. The game was released in four installments, in each of which the player is sent to a different SMB2 "World" to collect the Gold Mario Statues located in each level, defeat the boss, and then find and beat Wart, who can be battled in any world when going down in any vase while the player is in Subspace. The player can select the levels in any order and return to the levels as often as desired until the "episode" ends at around 50 minutes on the clock. The player starts the game as Mario, and character changing is forced in timed events. A points system was added. Points can be gained, among other things, by defeating enemies in various ways.</desc>

		<desc>BS The Legend of Zelda ( BS Zeruda no Densetsu) was a remake of the NES game The Legend of Zelda, released for the Satellaview attachment for the Super Famicom in Japan.
The gameplay was identical to its predecessor, but the maximum Rupees was increased to allow you more than a thousand (rather than 255 as in The Legend of Zelda), the overworld was heavily altered, and dungeons were completely different. This game was broadcasted in two versions, Map 1 and Map 2. Map 1 is sometimes referred to as a "Third Quest", in reference to The Legend of Zelda's Second Quest, and Map 2 would therefore be a Fourth Quest.
The game was divided into four weekly episodes, this is the first episode</desc>

It is a puzzle game where the objective is to defeat different colored germs using vitamins of the same color. It is basically four in a row just like Tetris (row or column counts) or to put it another way, to defeat each germ, three halves of the same color must be next to the germ. These halves do not need to be on the same pill. The germs will multiply as the levels progress.</desc>

It allowed for a party of up to four characters and had a few modern upgrades, such as allowing the player to distribute stats after a level up, target separate monsters and restart a battle if their party gets wiped out.

It received one direct sequel, Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes II, before the series would drop the Dragon Slayer prefix and continue as a separate Falcom property.</desc>

It was released exclusively for Nintendo's Satellaview system, which sent games to the Super Famicom via satellite signals, requiring a special adapter to receive and decode the data. This means that Dynami Tracer was never released in cartridge form, and as such, you can't purchase it anywhere, ever. The RPG aspect primarily involves your character going from star to star, interacting with the flamboyant locals and acquiring information. Every once in a while, you'll somehow get yourself involved in a race</desc>

Each version added a number of new characters, eventually adding up to six characters in all. The game plays similarly to Excitebike on the NES, although it does have a couple differences. One difference is the fact that the player can pick up coins along the racetrack (which do nothing besides adding to the score). The only other change was an added SUPER mode, which gave the player infinite boost.</desc>

		<desc>BS Excitebike Bun Bun Mario Stadium was the a game released in four downloadable versions on the Satellaview download service. The game is also known as Mario Excitebike. It was released for the Satellaview in 1996 only in Japan, and is the obscure sequel to the NES game Excitebike. Each version added a number of new characters, eventually adding up to six characters in all. The game plays similarly to Excitebike on the NES, although it does have a couple differences. One difference is the fact that the player can pick up coins along the racetrack (which do nothing besides adding to the score). The only other change was an added SUPER mode, which gave the player infinite boost.</desc>

		<name>F-zero</name>
		<desc>F-Zero is a futuristic racing game where the characters control flying cars and compete in an intergalactic tournament.
In total there are four characters with their own vehicle, each one having different characteristics. A race consists of giving five laps along a track, being mandatory to complete each one of them in one of the first places to avoid being disqualified. When a lap is completed the player is rewarded with a power called "Super Jet", which lasts for six seconds or so.
The objective of the game is to defeat the other characters by crossing the finish line at the end of a race, avoiding certain damage zones within the tracks. Each vehicle has its own energy meter, which works as a way of measuring the durability of the machines; this in turn decreases each time the player passes through a sandy area or collides, and energy can be recharged while driving over a pit stop.</desc>

		<desc>New Yatterman: Nandai Kandai Yajirobee is a multiplayer-focused game for the Super Famicom that is based on the 1970s Yatterman anime franchise.

Yatterman features a team of three heroes, all called Yatterman, who attempt to beat the supervillain team Doronbo (also a group of three) to a set of skull coins which will reveal the way to a giant treasure horde. The heroes often use toys and mechs to defeat their incompetent opponents, such as the male protagonist's kendamagic.

The game is similar to First Star's Spy vs. Spy series, in that both teams are attempting to reach the treasure first. They can trip up their opponents via a number of traps, some of which have conditional uses. By burying mines and setting off missiles, the player can whittle down the health of their opponents as well as keep them off their tracks. If the two teams meet, they fight each other in a three-on-three tag team battle with the losing side taking a large hit to their health. The game can be played single-player (as either the Yatterman team or the Doronbo team) or multiplayer.</desc>

		<name>Special Tee Shot</name>
		<desc>BS Special Tee Shot is a game that was planned to be released on the SNES, though eventually was just made exclusively for the Super Famicom's Satellaview service. The game was later retooled and made into the game that is known as Kirby's Dream Course. It is unknown why the game was remade to feature Kirby characters, though it's presumed that it as because Nintendo thought that the game would prove more successful with a well known brand behind it.
The Satellaview video game had unique characters rather than already developed ones. Overall, however, the player character was uninspiring as it was simply just a red sphere that bounced around. Despite the fact that the game would be remade to feature Kirby characters, there are dramatic differences between the two titles, including the overall gameplay concept and levels. For example, in this game, the goal was simply to shoot the ball in the hole, while in the Kirby game you want to crash into enemies to destroy them. However, despite this, the games still share many similarities, such as graphics and the overall way the player controls the ball.

Interestingly, Special Tee Shot was featured not only in magazines but also on the back of SNES packages as advertisements before ultimately being cancelled and brought back with Kirby characters. It should also be noted that before being titled Kirby's Dream Course, the game was officially called Kirby's Tee Shot.</desc>

		<name>BS Zelda no Densetsu</name>
		<desc>BS Zelda no Densetsu is a Downloadable 4-part Soundlink game for the Satellaview that was broadcast in at least 5 distinct runs between August 6, 1995 and January 4, 1997. A program called BS Zelda no Asobikata was also broadcast in the half-hour prior to broadcasts of BS Zelda. This program seems to have been a radio tutorial teaching players how to play BS Zelda. The gameplay draws directly from The Legend of Zelda. The plot of BS Zelda varies considerably from the plot of the original due in great part to the fact that the hero of the game is not Link (the hero of The Legend of Zelda). Instead, BS Zelda is closely associated with the story presented in the BS-X interface cartridge, with the Hero of Light actually representing the BS-X avatar according the the BS Zelda storyline. Another major factor in the plot of BS Zelda is the fact that the story is most closely related to the story given in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Both plots take up after the conclusion of Kamigami no Triforce - a fact that for Inishie no Sekiban produces one of the many plot inconsistencies/contradictions for which the series has become noted.</desc>

		<desc>Jissen Pachi-Slot Hisshouhou! Twin ("Combat Pachi-Slot Winning Strategy! Twin") is a pachi-slots game from Sammy Corporation. It is the first of two "Twin" spin-offs of the long-running Jissen Pachi-Slot Hisshouhou! series, both of which were released in 1997 for the Super Famicom. There was also a Jissen Pachi-Slot Hisshouhou! Twin for Saturn, but it used different machines and might be considered a separate game.

The game features two popular pachi-slots mascots in Japan: the Pink Panther, the popular feline character that originated in the 1960s Peter Sellers Inspector Clouseau movies, and Cranky Condor.</desc>

		<name>Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki</name>
		<desc>This text-based adventure (with some interesting background graphics) was originally released in Japan over the Satellaview system. The game is a spin-off from the Chrono Series, and was the precursor to Chrono Cross. It tells the story of Serge (travelling musician), Kid (thief), and Magil (wizard) as they attempt to steal the Frozen Flame from Viper Manor.  Contains multiple, often humorous endings. An interesting game for Chrono Trigger/Cross fans, as this was the game that Chrono Cross was essentially a remake of.

Gameplay is something between a standard text adventure and a Choose Your Own Adventure book.  Rather than having a full array of possible actions, players are limited to the several options it presents at any time.  With newly discovered items and information, new areas can be reached.  Occasionally battles will occur during the exploration, which are also handled by displaying several possible actions to choose between, such as "Run" or "Jump back as it swings!"

		<name>Wild Guns</name>
		<desc>KABOOM!

Annie &amp; Clint, two gunslingers, arrive at Carson City and get caught up in a gunfight. It's raining bullets and there are explosions everywhere. After an intense battle they enter the saloon where they dispose of every cowboy in sight while redecorating the interior. Our heroes flee the scene by climbing on the roof, but what's that sound? ... it's a HUGE robot!

Wild Guns is a shooter with a western &amp; Sci Fi theme. Gameplay is somewhat similar to the Time Crisis &amp; House of the Dead games, with the exception that the game isn't played from a first-person perspective but from a third-person perspective. You control your on-screen character as well as the aiming crosshair (at the same time). Select either Clint (yes, inspired by Mr. Eastwood) or Annie and shoot down tons of enemies while dodging bullets and jumping over incoming rockets.

After the Carson City level, the action continues in Desolation Canyon, an ammunition depot, a gold mine and a armored train (you can play these levels in any order). Finally there's a showdown with the big bad guy. Each of the 6 levels is divided into 3 sublevels. The 3rd one is always a boss-battle. During the game your standard weapon can be temporarily upgraded by collecting power-ups. If you want to create some serious mayhem you can detonate one of your bombs. Almost any object in the background can be destroyed.

Wild Guns has a two-player co-op mode. There's also a shooting gallery mode in which you can't die; this one is all about scoring as many points as possible.</desc>

It also bears similarities to other Mystery Dungeon games including Dragon Quest Yangus, The Nightmare of Druaga, and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. Like other Mystery Dungeon games, it is set in a fantasy land based on feudal Japan, and it falls into the roguelike genre. The titular hero of the game, Shiren the Wanderer, moves in a turn-based fashion through a series of maps filled with monsters, traps, and items. The maps, referred to as dungeons, take a variety of forms including traditional dungeons, caves, forests, etc. When a player is slain, he begins at the start again with stats at the base level, however he can regain items that had previously been stored a warehouse.</desc>

		<desc>BS Super Mario Collection is a remix of Super Mario Collection (the Japanese name for Super Mario All-Stars) for the Satellaview, an add-on for the Super Famicom. The game was released in four installments. As the game played, streamed audio would enhance the gameplay experience with special music and voice acting featuring Japanese celebrities. Its "companion title" is BS Super Mario USA. A Fire Flower icon represents Nae's house, which is hosted by a Satellaview Radio Personality Nae Yūki. Here, Mario can choose to activate ghost mode which allows him to become Fire Mario once he exits the level if he is Small or Super Mario. This in turn disables players from participating in rankings. A Treasure Ship icon, which is unlocked when Mario finishes all available levels in the World. Toad's House is now just a screen where the player selects the treasure chest, rather than having Mario actually walk to the chest and open it. There is a timer in the bottom left of the screen that counts down to the end of a World cycle. At the beginning of each world, there is a list of all the levels, and a picture with dialog underneath it.</desc>

A program called BS Zelda no Asobikata was also broadcast in the half-hour prior to broadcasts of BS Zelda. This program seems to have been a radio tutorial teaching players how to play BS Zelda. The gameplay draws directly from The Legend of Zelda. The plot of BS Zelda varies considerably from the plot of the original due in great part to the fact that the hero of the game is not Link (the hero of The Legend of Zelda). Instead, BS Zelda is closely associated with the story presented in the BS-X interface cartridge, with the Hero of Light actually representing the BS-X avatar according the the BS Zelda storyline. Another major factor in the plot of BS Zelda is the fact that the story is most closely related to the story given in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Both plots take up after the conclusion of Kamigami no Triforce - a fact that for Inishie no Sekiban produces one of the many plot inconsistencies/contradictions for which the series has become noted.</desc>

It was a remake sequel to the earlier Shin Onigashima. The major difference between the two games relate to the SoundLink elements that were introduced for the Satellaview broadcasts. The plot of BS Shin Onigashima comes from the original Shin Onigashima, however it is presented from the perspective of the three animal helpers (dog, monkey, and pheasant) who join the heroes as NPCs during the original game. The game was divided into 4 chapters which were retained for the later Nintendo Power and SFC remake. BS Shin Onigashima makes use of an expanded orchestral score that was broadcast via satellite radio, and in-game narration in the voice of the main-character, Ittaisan, was broadcast via SoundLink between chapters to advance the storyline. The game employs command menu gameplay just as in Shin Onigashima, however in BS Shin Onigashima the option to change character mid-game was removed. Other differences included the addition of platform-style action scenes, and time limits associated with making certain commands.</desc>

These could be downloaded to the Satellaview base unit, or an 8-megabit rewritable "Memory Pak" ROM cartridge compatible with the Satellaview. As these games did not use the SoundLink live audio streaming technology utilized by other Satellaview games, after being downloaded, they could be played at any time after the broadcast as long as they were not deleted or overwritten.</desc>

The game features strategy-based combat in addition to traditional role-playing game elements in two-dimensional environments. The game was later re-released for Satellaview in March 1998. Players assume the role of Albert, the young heroic swordsman who lives in a fantasy world filled with monsters and mythical creatures. While much of the world remains in relative peace following a great war many years before, a military faction led by the dark magician Globus has emerged to conquer the newly pacified nations and expand their empire. With the help of Albert's friends as well as hired mercenaries, the player must travel the world and eventually confront Golbus and his forces to prevent another large-scale conflict.</desc>

		<desc>ActRaiser (BS) is byte-for-byte (sans header) identical to the Japanese retail version (Although it seems it's saving system is not as functional on a real hardware setup.  The player plays as "The Master," the main protagonist of the game. Although the Master is never directly controlled, the player interacts with the world by controlling an angel and an animated statue. The player plays as an angel during the simulation sequences of the game, and as the statue during the action sequences.

The overhead-view simulation mode involves protecting and guiding the Master's new civilization towards prosperity, beginning with two humans. This portion of the game requires the player to take actions that encourage the growth of the population, including road planning and using lightning, rain, sunlight, wind, and earthquakes as miracles. The Angel can interact with the monsters in the area by shooting them with arrows as well as aid the Master by indicating where to build and use miracles.

Each area has two side-scrolling action sequences, one before the building simulation and near the end. In the action sequences, the player controls a human-shaped statue brought to life by the Master. The player must jump from platform to platform while defeating monsters to accrue a score. At the end of each action sequence, the player must defeat a boss. 

Among many things, the game is recognized for its score, which was composed by Yuzo Koshiro. Its release within six months of the launch of the console demonstrated the compositional potential it represented to future projects, underscoring its ability to use and manipulate comparatively high quality samples.</desc>

		<desc>BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2 is the direct sequel to the original F-Zero game released for the Super Famicom via the Satellaview. Two versions were released - a non-SoundLink game and a SoundLink game. The original non-SoundLink version was released as BSF-Zero 2 Practice on June 1, 1997 (although the title screen remained the same). It contained the four courses first seen throughout BS F-Zero Grand Prix (a Satellaview remake of the original), along with a new course called Mute City IV. Little is known about the later SoundLink version outside of surviving videos, but it was distributed in two halves in August 1997 and had a similar announcer and redone soundtrack as the previous Satellaview entry. At least the first week rearranged a few courses, and replaced two with new locations called "Forest I" and "Forest II". Presuming no areas were repeated, this likely means the SoundLink version had twice as many courses total. In addition, it can be seen that the player cannot choose between Grand Prix and Practice modes in the SoundLink version; as it was a live broadcast, the player is forced to play each course in a timed Practice mode, and then the Grand Prix race.</desc>

		<desc>BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge is an ura- or gaiden-version of Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Satellaview system featuring graphical enhancements similar to its Super Mario All-Stars version. While the underlying gameplay itself is largely similar, some content has been rearranged and new content has been added. The game was released in four installments, in each of which the player is sent to a different SMB2 "World" to collect the Gold Mario Statues located in each level, defeat the boss, and then find and beat Wart, who can be battled in any world when going down in any vase while the player is in Subspace. The player can select the levels in any order and return to the levels as often as desired until the "episode" ends at around 50 minutes on the clock. The player starts the game as Mario, and character changing is forced in timed events. A points system was added. Points can be gained, among other things, by defeating enemies in various ways.</desc>
