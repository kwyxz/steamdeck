		<name>Puzzle Link</name>
		<desc>Puzzle Link is a game where blocks of matching color have to be dissolved. New blocks constantly scroll into the screen from the top. The game is over when the first blocks reach the bottom of the screen. You can dissolve blocks by shooting at them. The shots form a line where they impact. If that line connects otherwise unconnected blocks of the same color they will dissolve.

There are three different modes: In "Normal" you have to link two special blocks that appear after some time. If you manage to finish the level within the time limit you will unlock one of 50 collectible cards. In "Clear Mode" you have to clear a given constellation of blocks. "Battle Mode" is a two player link-cable mode.</desc>

		<path>./Samurai Shodown! - Pocket Fighting Series (Japan, Europe) (En,Ja).ngp.zip</path>
		<name>Samurai Shodown!</name>
		<desc>Samurai Shodown! Pocket is essentially a "portable" version of Samurai Shodown 4. Like the other fighting games on the Neo Geo Pocket, the characters are drawn in Super Deformed chibi style (big heads and tiny bodies). This title was also one of the first games for the Neo Geo Pocket, so the game was only in black and white... The gameplay of Samurai Shodown is quite well adapted in the pocket version, but it is not as enjoyable as the Neo Geo classic. The gameplay is very simplified in this version. The characters keep most of their special moves and moves, but the deep strategies of the arcade are almost gone. It's basically a new game that, while not spectacular, is fun.</desc>
