		<path>./Etrian Odyssey (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Etrian Odyssey</name>
		<desc>Far away in a vast fertile land lies a small town called Etria.  Peaceful and serene, Etria became famous when a labyrinth was discovered at the edge of its woods.  Those who heard of the labyrinth began to harbor dreams of exploring it.  And so many explorers from all over the world flocked to Etria in dream of achieving wealth, fame, and fortune exploring the vast and mysterious labyrinth.

Etrian Odyssey is a first-person RPG which pits you as an eager adventurer ready to face the dangers of the labyrinth.  At the beginning of the game you are required to create your own "adventuring guild" by creating various characters out of 9 different classes.  You can create as many as you want, but everything costs money, so strategic thinking is a must.  As well, you can only take a party of 5 into the labyrinth, so the remaining characters have to stay in town at the guild hall.  Battles are done in the traditional turn-based style, and he game contains over 125 monsters that guard the labyrinth and the area around it.  Movement is done one step at a time, with players moving in restricted directions (forward, back, left right).  Most of the game is focused on exploring deeper and deeper into the labyrinth while still returning to town in order to restock and resupply.  During the return trips to town, you can also switch out characters in your party if a special class is needed to pass obstacles in the labyrinth.  Also, players are only allowed to save during the return trip to town, making trips to the labyrinth both risky and exciting.

The labyrinth is completely unknown and unexplored, and so one of the important features of the game is the necessity to draw your own maps.  The top screen of the DS shows the action, while the bottom screen shows a gridded area.  In this area, you have to use the stylus to draw out all of your maps.  This means not only marking where the walls and doors are, but having to mark where enemies, treasures, special areas, and staircases are.  It is completely up to you how accurately or haphazardly you want to draw your map.  However, the only way to get out of the labyrinth is to return to the start, so the gameplay becomes even riskier the further you venture into the dungeon.  Managing your map poorly may risk you and party's lives.  Map making is a key concept of this game because it emphasizes adventuring into the unknown and finding out what's around the very next corner.</desc>

		<name>Infinite Space</name>
		<desc>Growing up as a second class citizen on a back-water planet, Yuri dreamed of being able to travel the stars. After many years he saved up enough credits to buy transport off the planet, but space travel is forbidden to second class citizens, and he is chased by the security forces of the corrupt owner of the planet. To survive the dangers of space Yuri must become a captain, buy and customize star ships, and fight against hostile enemies both on the ground and in space.

The majority of Infinite Space's gameplay involves space ships, both in fighting and in modifying. All ships have a certain amount of space for extra modules to be added, and the abilities and shape of modules must be considered when choosing how to outfit a ship. In ship to ship combat you can control the distance your fleet is from the enemy fleet. During combat a command bar charges. You can use a small amount of the command bar to Dodge, use more to fire a Normal salvo, or expend almost all of it for a Barrage, which fires three times as many shots as Normal. If the opposing fleet uses Dodge before a Barrage then every shot will miss, leaving the attacking fleet at a disadvantage. If a Normal salvo is fired while the opposing fleet is Dodging, then every shot will hit and deal extra damage. Extra combat options come into play with larger star ships equipped with fighter hangars, special weapons, boarding parties, and officers with unique abilities.

The story progresses primarily with text dialogue and the occasional FMV. Sometimes the player is prompted to make a decision in dialogue for Yuri, and these decisions can have far reaching consequences. Additional officers can join Yuri through the story, by hiring them at a mercenary office, or by finding them on various planets. All officers have unique stats and abilities that make them better for a particular role, such as doctor, engineer, or pilot, than others, and these stats and abilities increase in level from combat.</desc>

		<name>Jump Ultimate Stars</name>
		<desc>Jump Ultimate Stars is more or less an expanded version of the original game, Jump Super Stars. It features the same Super Smash Bros.-style fighting gameplay with a plethora of licensed manga characters, bringing in a wide variety of new franchises and characters. The roster has been expanded to more than 300 characters from 41 different manga titles. There is also Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection support, making global internet play a possibility.

Generally, the game is structured the same as the previous title. The player sets up decks made up of the three types of panels, which can be used on the fly with the touchscreen. There is a story mode, versus modes, several single-player modes, as well as a quiz mode and information archives and story synopses for each series. The method of obtaining new panels has changed, however: each character has a progress tree, and successful battles earn gems which can be spent to power up different characters.

The complete list of series represented is: Eyeshield 21, I''s, Ichigo 100%, Katekyo Hitman Reborn!, Captain Tsubasa, Gintama, Kinnikuman, Kochi Kame, Cobra, Sakigake!! Otoko Juku, Jigoku Sensei Nube, Shaman King, Jungle no Tar-chan, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Slam Dunk, Saint Seiya, Taizo Mote Ou Saga, D.Gray-man, Death Note, The Prince of Tennis, Dr. Slump, Tottemo!

		<path>./Lunar Knights (USA) (En,Es).zip</path>
		<name>Lunar Knights</name>
		<desc>Many years into the future, a race of vampires have emerged, plunging planet Earth into darkness with an environmental control system called the 'paraSOL'.  They now control the planet, with humans living in fear.  When all hope seems lost, two boys with amazing power emerge to save the planet.  The Dark Swordsman, Lucian, and a rookie member of the vampire fighting 'Guild', Aaron.

Lunar Knights is an indirect sequel to the Boktai series of games, which takes place many years after.  Its focus is much more on action as opposed to stealth, although some stealth elements from the earlier games remain (for example, you can blow into the microphone to whistle and attract the attention of enemies).  Players control the two characters, Lucian and Aaron.  Lucian fights with a huge sword called 'Vanagand'.  As a result, Lucian has a close combat style.  Lucian uses the power of moonlight to fuel his special attacks and moves.

The other character is Aaron, a gunslinger for the Guild.  He fights by using sunlight to charge up his gun, the Knight, and shoot ranged shots at foes.  Aaron's special attacks and moves use up sunlight.  Both Aaron and Lucian can use junk materials to increase the level of their weaponry, giving them more power.

The main goal of the game is to make your way through the dungeons and purify the vampire at the end.  The dungeons themselves are fairly standard - you search for treasure chests, avoid traps and solve puzzles.  At the end, you'll fight a boss vampire, and once you've defeated them, the Casket Rocket will be called.  Because the vampires have blocked out the sun on Earth, you'll need to take the vampire into space to purify them.

At this point, the game becomes a touch screen controlled shooter.  To control the ship itself, you drag it around the screen with the stylus.  To shoot enemy ships, you tap them with the screen.  Once you reach the end, the vampire will be purified by the magnified power of the sun.</desc>

		<name>The World Ends With You</name>
		<desc>The World Ends With You is an action-RPG that puts players in the role of Neku Sakuraba, a sullen, loner of a teenager who wakes up to find himself in modern day Shibuya, Japan, with no memory of how he got there and a ticking clock in his hand that tells him to complete the mission... or face erasure.

Neku and his partner Shiki Misaki find themselves as "Players" in a game that lasts seven days.  Each day, players are given various missions to perform by the "Reapers" within a certain time limit, or be erased from existence.

Players use collectible pins to amplify their combat powers against "The Noise", animal-like creatures which can corrupt the people and environment around them.  Each pin is activated in a different manner, from tapping the touchscreen, making sweeping motions with the stylus, or even blowing into the DS microphone.  Neku fights on the lower screen of the DS, while his partner fights on the upper screen.  Their combat styles are different, but can be combined to form more powerful attacks.  

Players can purchase clothing to increase the effectiveness of their attacks, and gain PP points to enhance their pin abilities.  PP is usally gained through combat, but can also be gained by coming into wi-fi contact with another person's DS.

There is also a wi-fi mini-game called "Ten Pin Slammer", where players can use one pin at a time to knock the other players' pins off the gameboard.</desc>
