		<desc>Final Fight Revenge was the last game released on the Saturn in Japan on the 3rd of March 2000, it is a conversion of the ST-V coin op,which to my knowledge did not receive great distribution.

During each level, your quad leader informs you of the critical areas inside certain buildings, such as multi-level warehouses.
Following his advice, you must use your cybernetic powersuit to put out the flames in each area. Along the way you will also come across boss characters, who are out to light up the town, and you.
Your performance is then rated on your time to complete the objectives, how many lives were saved, and so forth. The better you go, the higher the rating.</desc>

		<path>./Clockwork Knight - Pepperouchau's Adventure (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Clockwork Knight : Pepperouchau no Daibouken Joukan</name>
		<desc>Clockwork Knight is a game that depicts the sometimes friendly, sometimes combative, secret lives of toys. Betsy has a huge number of toys that come to life in the absence of humans and normally play nicely with each other. In the opening introduction, the somewhat inept clockwork knight Pepperouchau is competing with some other knights for the affections of a princess who lives in the clock. Everyone is having a grand time until a rogue toy shows up through the air vent, absconds with the princess, and turns many of the other toys against Pepperouchau.

The gameplay consists of side scrolling action through various stages constructed of elaborate series of toys, traps, and common household items. The first stage is a quest through Betsy's room with lots of letter blocks, sharp crayons, and dollhouses precariously balanced on robots that tend to fall on you. Pepperouchau is armed with a key sword that has offensive use as well as the ability to open boxes that functions as warps to other areas. The second stage takes place in Betsy's brother's room. Kevin has a lot of engineering skill and has built an impressive network of cranes and trains that Pepperouchau will need to activate in order to clear the area. Watch out for the jet transformer boss at the end of the room.

Other stages include missions through other areas of the house including the kitchen and the attic. Throughout the game you also collect coins. 20 coins are worth a continue when you run out of lives. Further, you meet other friendly toys between levels who give you the opportunity to gamble with your earned coins.</desc>

		<desc>Clockwork Knight 2 is the second (and to this date, last) game featuring the adventures of Sir Tongara de Pepperouchau III. It maintains the same game style (a mixture of 2D side-scrolling platformer with 3D elements, moderately in the fashion of Sega Saturn's Bug!), colorful music and gameplay of its predecessor. However, your mission will be somewhat different this time (although still related with Clockwork Princess Chelsea), as the ending scene of the first game did not come as good as expected and because of that, you should try to give the best of yourself again in order to completely recover Chelsea for Pepperouchau.</desc>

Die Hard 1 is a third person shooter in a style similar to Tomb Raider.  You are John McClane and must fight through twenty floors of terrorists in the Nakatomi Plaza.  The game has an invisible wall effect which allows you to see John even in small hallways.

Die Hard 2 is a first person rail shooter in the vein of Virtua Cop or Mad Dog McCree.  Once again you take the role of John  McClane firing upon terrorists who happen to be ransacking the Washington/Dulles Airport in search of a South American dictator and druglord.

Die Hard 3 is a fast-paced taxi racer through the city.  John must this time speed through New York City defusing bombs and ramming evildoers off the road behind the wheel of a cab.</desc>

		<path>./Fighters Megamix (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Fighters Megamix</name>
		<desc>Virtua Fighter 2 was full of many brand new gameplay elements implemented into the realistic fighting engine of the first Virtua Fighter.  The Virtua Fighter series has been heralded before as the fighting game with most involving gameplay.  

In Fighters Megamix, another game has been added, a game called Fighting Vipers.  Fighting Vipers has drastically different gameplay than the more popular Virtua Fighter 2.  Instead of being sophisticated, Fighting Vipers is simplified to appeal to a wider audience of video gamers and was meant for "casual" gamers.

Mixing a simplistic video game and a sophisticated video game must have been difficult.  But Fighters Megamix manages to do so by offering many options.  The most important option available is the choice of having Fighters Megamix run under the Fighting Vipers style of gameplay or the Virtua Fighter 2 style of gameplay.  Other options are unlockable while playing the game.

One good thing about mixing two games into one is that the game would include more selectable characters.  Not only are there the 22 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers but there are also 10 other hidden characters that can be unlocked by playing well in the Saturn version, including two from the arcade-only Sonic the Fighters. There are only 4 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and 4 from Fighting Vipers in the Game.Com version.

This game was one of the very last games to appear on the Sega Saturn in the United States and was directed by Yu Suzuki.</desc>

		<name>Fighting Vipers</name>
		<desc>Armstone City, year unknown. The Mayor decided to hold a fighting tournament with the grand finale being held on the top of the city tower, and the Vipers, young urban warriors decide to compete, each with their own goal on mind. All eight came from several backgrounds, like the hard-rocker Raxel, the orphan with a burning desire to meet his father Bahn, former gang leader Tokyo, queen of the catwalk Grace, the giant with an unknown past Sanman, construction worker and former marine trainee Jane, fashion designer to-be Candy and skater boy Picky, plus Mahler, someone with a score to settle with the Mayor.

While based on the same Model-2 arcade board as Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting Vipers included several changes, such as a wall surrounding the battle area and equipping each fighter with a two-piece (chest and legs) armour that can only be broken with power hits. Once the armour is gone, the unfortunate fighter is more vulnerable to opponent hits, and damage can also be collected after hitting the wall or floor after a throw. 

Gameplay is also radically different from Virtua Fighter - noticeably  faster, with combos done by fast button-mashing sequences sometimes on the same button, instead of the timed presses that require an additional push on the d-pad of the first title. Another new addition to gameplay is the Quick recovery, which allows a fighter that suffered a severe blow to quickly get on his feet, avoiding damage and allowing for a quick counter, but at the same time leaving him open for another blow if the opponent is fast enough. to react.

Game modes include Arcade, Vs, Team Battle (best of 9) and Training. Game options allow the player to tweak the difficulty setting, number of rounds before a match winner is decided, size of life bars, if there's a time limit, if the order of opponents is random or predefined and between three game modes: Original (based on the arcade version), Arrange (gameplay tweaked for the Sega Saturn) and Hyper (allows Vipers to voluntarily drop their armour, allowing to perform special attacks at lightening fast speeds), Stage selection, and to change the disposition of the control pad to better suit the players' style.

Another mode, Playback, allows to see rounds previously saved by the player or fighting demos recorded by the AM#2 staff, each with the ability to choose a camera. As usual with Sega's fighting ports, extensive bookkeeping is included, as well as a few hidden characters.</desc>

		<name>Guardian Heroes</name>
		<desc>Treasure's unique scrolling beat-em-up/RPG hybrid, Guardian Heroes introduces the player to a motley crew of heroes (Consisting of a swordsman, a ninja, a cleric and a mage), formed to find a "legendary sword". The game begins with the heroes in a bar, having found this sword, as they decide what to do with it. Before they have a chance to come up with an idea however, they are interrupted as an Imperial General charges in and warns them they are in grave danger. Seconds later, Imperial troops swarm into the inn and the heroes are forced to take flight along with this general.

The fighting mechanic is slightly deeper than the average scrolling beat-em-up, with light and heavy attacks, special moves (executed the same way you'd expect a normal beat-em-up to work), magical attacks and the ability to block. As you defeat enemies you gain experience points, with which you can upgrade your character between levels - sharing them between various factors such as strength, speed, constitution and magic resistance.

Even more interesting however is the hugely branching storyline, which changes according to decisions you make (of which there are many) and which character you select to play with.

Also of note is the fact that even in one-player mode there are always two of you on screen - you command the other character by changing his "mood" - aggressive, cowardly etc. - of which there are six. On top of this, it is possible to play the game as a more traditional beat-em-up with up to six players/bots, and in this mode you can play as any character that you have encountered during the main game mode.</desc>

		<desc>"Violent fighting to come again!"

SNK's flagship series returns for another year. Many of the changes in this year's KOF release come in the form of improved graphics, sound effects, music and totally redone character sprites. The gameplay of the system has been altered with the addition of "Rush" multi-hit combos and new moves for practically every character. The storyline of the series receives heavy focus in this release with the Orochi Saga swinging into high-gear.

The King of Fighters '96 has 27 regular characters plus 2 boss characters (who can be unlocked with the use of a code). Newcomers to the tournament include Mr. Big from the Art of Fighting series, the bosses from Fatal Fury (Wolfgang Krauser and Geese Howard), and completely original characters like Leona Heidern, Mature and Vice. Other features carried over from the previous year include the ability to choose between the default "Team Fighting" mode or the traditional "Single Fighter" style of gameplay, plus the "Versus" and "Survival" gameplay modes.</desc>

Everyone knew refusing to participate was not an option.

Just like in Virtua Fighter 2, you fight in 3D stages and every character has its unique style and feel. But unlike the PC version of Virtua Fighter 2, where the background of every stage is a flat picture, in Last Bronx all the scenery is done in 3D.

		<name>Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</name>
		<desc>Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter is a 2D fighting game and the first to combine characters from Capcom's Street Fighter series with those of the Marvel comic universe. It is also the first in Capcom's games to introduce a tag team style of combat where the player can call for another character during a fight.

Matches consists of two-on-two battles where the player can only control one character at a time. The other character can be called in regularly or while doing an attack. The off-screen one also regains some health while waiting. Both opposing characters need to be defeated to win the match, and when one dies the other is called in automatically. The tag team options introduces Variable Attack, Variable Counter and Variable Combination where the two characters team up to attack, counter of perform a special move.

Most of the X-Men characters were already present in X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes: Cyclops, Storm, Juggernaut, Magneto and Wolverine, with the addition of Rogue, Gambit and Sabretooth. The Street Fighter characters are gathered from Street Fighter Alpha 2: Ryu, Ken, Cammy/Chun-Li, Charlie, Zangief, Dhalsim, M. Bison and Akuma. The final boss of the game is Apocalypse.

The PlayStation version does not include the tag team feature and relies on the more traditional best-two-of-three round setup.</desc>

		<desc>Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon games, but it differs from the rest of the series by having strong RPG elements.

The hero of the game is Edge, one of the soldiers of the mighty Empire. The Empire has recently ordered some excavations at ancient ruins, trying to discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden, one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict... or are there more?

"Panzer Dragon Saga" combines elements of shooter and role-playing. You don't have a party in the game: you control only Edge on his dragon, who is in fact the playable character in battles. You move around through the game's fully 3D world by flying on the dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot. During battles, you can shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of your dragons. You shoot in real time, and can also move around to attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks. The dragon gets experience points for fighting and also gains levels. You will be able to customize your dragon by assigning to him one of the four available dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.</desc>

		<name>Shining Force III</name>
		<desc>Set in a world of fantasy and magic, Shining Force III places you in the boots of a young general, fighting to preserve the peace in your world. The story starts out as the Emperor is abducted from within the city of Saraband, and you must go on the run with your king, who is suspected of being the mastermind behind the abduction. Of course, things are not as they seem, and you will be taken through a web of lies and deceit in your quest to prove the King innocent.

The game is very similar in style to the earlier Shining Force titles, so anyone who's played them will be comfortable with the game, though likely they'll also be happy to find the game graphically overhauled, with a 3-D landscape and 3D characters during the battle animations. As ever the main game is controlled like a traditional RPG, with you controlling the main character, talking to NPC's and searching various items. However, the main selling point of the Shining Force series has always been its battle sequences. 

The combat system is amended from the earlier titles, with a new and unique "friendship" system, whereby the more two characters work together (helping each other out, healing each other etc.) the closer they bond, and they will start to give each other bonuses on the battlefield. Other traditional features, such as the rock-paper-scissors nature of the weapons (sword beats axe, axe beats spear, spear beats sword etc.) and the terrain effects (someone hiding in a forest is going to get better protection than someone on an open road) remain fully intact, and anyone who's played the earlier titles in the series will likely be very comfortable with the combat system.

It should be noted that this is actually the western conversion of Shining Force III: Episode I, and was therefore only the first episode in an intended series of three. Unfortunately the other two titles were never released outside of Japan, so most western gamers were only able to experience a third of the storyline.</desc>

		<name>Virtua Fighter 2</name>
		<desc>One year after after the first tournament Akira, Wolf, Pai, Jeffry, Kage, Jacky, Sarah and defending champion Lau are invited to the World Fighting Tournament, and are joined by the master of drunken Kung-Fu Shun-di, who wants to prove he's more than an old geezer and Lion Rafale, who's fighting for his freedom. Each fighter has his own style, from the lightning fast attacks of Pai to the powerful slams of Jeffry.

Home port of Sega's popular Model 2A arcade vs. fighter released in 1995. Game modes include classic arcade mode, 2P vs mode, Expert mode (where the computer character progressively learns and counters players' technique), Ranking Mode (similar to Arcade, but at the end, a fighting style analysis is shown based on number of specials and time to knock down an opponent), Team Battle Mode (two teams composed of five fighters go against each other, the first to beat five characters being the winner) and Watch mode (allows choosing two fighters and then see them fighting). Both VF2 and VF2.1 (a tweaked version available only in Japan) modes are included. Gameplay keeps the same style from the first game, adding more moves to each fighters' roll. Using a three-key layout (block, kick and punch, being possible to assign button combinations to the extra keys) the player is able to control their fighter, aiming to knock or push the opponent outside the rink inside the time limit. Combo moves range from the quickest, which require the player to push up to five buttons quickly, to strong moves that require more button presses along d-pad nudges to be successful. As with the previous game, fighting is realistic (except the physics-defying leaps), and each fighter has nothing but their body to harm the opponent.

While in comparison with the arcade version some parts took a hit on graphical quality (such as the texture details and backgrounds), the game uses the Saturn High-Resolution mode and flowing 60-fps  to bring the arcade experience home.</desc>

		<name>Virtua Racing</name>
		<desc>Virtua Racing or V.R. for short, is a Formula One racing arcade game, developed by Sega AM2 and released in 1992. Virtua Racing was initially a proof-of-concept application for exercising a new 3D-graphics platform under development, the "Model 1". The results were so encouraging, that Virtua Racing was fully developed into a standalone arcade title. Though its use of 3D polygonal graphics was predated by arcade rivals Namco (Winning Run in 1988) and Atari (Hard Drivin' in 1989), Virtua Racing had vastly improved visuals in terms of polygon count, frame rate, and overall scene complexity, and displayed multiple camera angles and 3D human non-player characters, which all contributed to a greater sense of immersion. Virtua Racing is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for laying the foundations for subsequent 3D racing games and for popularizing 3D polygonal graphics among a wider audience</desc>

		<name>Radiant Silvergun</name>
		<desc>The story of Radiant Silvergun begins with the end of the world. As the pilot of the starfighter Radiant Silvergun you are sent back in time in search of the key to save the planet. In various time periods you will battle hordes of enemies in search for an alien being knows as the Origin. Only by destroying the Origin can the dark future of the planet be altered.

Radiant Silvergun is a top-down shooter from the Japanese codeshop Treasure (Gunstar Heroes, Silhouette Mirage) released in Japan for the Sega Saturn in 1998. To tackle the swarm of enemies that fill your screen you got three different means of attack. A straight shot, a homing laser and a devastating spread shot.

In 2002 Radiant Silvergun got its spiritual successor in the Dreamcast release of Ikaruga, which would later be converted for the Nintendo Gamecube.</desc>

		<name>Sega Rally Championship</name>
		<desc>Sega Rally was a major success in the arcades, bringing rally-style racing to the masses before the Colin McRae games. Four detailed tracks have been created, with a succession of stomach-churning bends and jumps, and you can choose from 3 different cars. As well as the main championship, there is a time-trial mode featuring a ghost car to beat, so you always know how your run compares with your best-ever. Two machines can be linked for multi-player action. The handling of the cars is unrealistic, to put the focus on action and instant playability.</desc>

		<name>Contra : Legacy of War</name>
		<desc>Contra: Legacy of War is a 3D action game produced by Konami and developed by Appaloosa Interactive that was originally released in 1996 for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. It was the first of two Contra games that were externally developed by Appaloosa, followed by C: The Contra Adventure in 1998. The game marks the series' jump to three-dimensional graphics and controversial changes in gameplay. Legacy of War was released packaged with a pair of 3D anaglyph glasses, which the game supported. Legacy of War bears the distinction for being the first console game in the series to retain both the Contra title and human characters during its release in Europe and Australia (where the console series has been known as Probotector from the first NES game and up until Contra: Hard Corps). The game was scheduled to be released in Japan as well,[1] but was canceled.</desc>

		<path>./Daytona USA (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Daytona USA</name>
		<desc>A port of the most successful arcade racer ever, the home versions of Daytona USA include the same elements that made the original version successful: three highly detailed tracks, arcade driving physics that challenge the player to find the best trajectory to make a flying lap without kissing the rails and beating the checkpoint timer. The 40 cars of the Easy race (later named 3-7 Speedway), one of the stalwarts of the original version, are also present in this version.

These home versions include a new mode (Saturn or PC Mode, depending on the platform) where the three tracks are played without the timer, and optionally in mirror mode, using one of the bonus cars (with additional abilities such as driving on grass or hitting the rails without losing speed) and in one of three lengths: Normal (identical to the arcade original), Grand Prix (2.5 times longer) and Endurance (10 times longer). 

On the downside, detail and frame rate suffered a drop to fit the game into the limited hardware of the Saturn and Personal Computers, and lacking any kind of multiplayer, comparing to the two to eight player rumbles of the arcade version.</desc>
