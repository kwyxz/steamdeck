		<name>10-Yard Fight</name>
		<desc>10-Yard Fight is a simple arcade game based on American football. One player can play against the computer or a second player head-to-head matchup and can choose between five levels of difficulty (high school, college, pro, playoffs, and Super Bowl). If you win a game at a lower difficulty level, the following game is automatically played at the next highest difficulty level.

Gameplay is top-down and vertical-scrolling. There are no plays or formations to select from before the action begins; the player can take the snap as quarterback or choose one of two players on defense. On offense, the player can either keep the ball on the run, toss it to one of the two running backs, or throw long to the receiver; an interception turns the ball over to the other team. If a touchdown can't be scored, then the directional kicking system can be used to punt the ball or try for a field goal. One game consists (accelerated real-time) 30-minute halves of play to decide who wins this 10-Yard Fight.</desc>

Updates to the gameplay include an energy bar, which can be run down by either being hit from incoming fire or using a special weapon. The energy bar can be replenished by picking up power-ups, while special weapons (lightning, cyclones and waves) can knock down all fighters on the screen at the time.

		<name>1999 - Hore, Mita Koto Ka! Seikimatsu</name>
		<desc>Four Japanese high-school students were camping at the countryside, when they suddenly saw an UFO landing nearby. Before they managed to understand anything, a small pink alien with a strict-looking face came out of the space ship and announced that the end of the century is near - and something extraordinary will happen in the year 1999.

That's where the game begins. You can play as one (or two, in 2-player mode) of the students, competing against the others. You must prepare for the upcoming end of the century, earn enough money, and generally manage your life well. This is a Monopoly-like board game, only instead of dices you use cards. The characters are represented by small cars on a city map. The number that appears on the card you pull from the deck represents the amount of squares your car can move on the map. Each square leads to a different event: accident, romantic meeting, promotion, etc. Some of the events allow you to make an additional choice. For example, if you land in a casino, you'll be asked if you want to gamble. Answering "yes" will lead to a slot machine mini-game.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you must help a little boy to become a baseball star. Your goal is to make it through elementary school and high school, to build up his personality (making him more attractive, etc.), and finally let him be drafted by a professional baseball team. All this is achieved through playing (alone, vs. computer, or in two-, three-, and four-player mode) a board game in which you take your hero through a series of fields. Unlike most similar games, the amount of fields you can advance is not determined by a dice roll, but by a moving power meter that you must stop at the right time in order to jump the desired amount of fields. Needless to say that those fields have very different effects on the participants. There are different stats (like stamina, charisma, etc.) that can be increased or reduced if you step on a particular field. For example, you might end up on a "eating" field, which will take you to a friend who will invite you to a dinner. This will result in increased weight, a parameter that will affect your future performance.</desc>

		<name>The Addams Family</name>
		<desc>The Addams Family is a side-scrolling platformer based on the movie of the same name. The player takes the role of Gomez who searches for his missing family members. To find them he has to explore six different parts of the mansion, e.g. the woods, which are basic platform levels: the player moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. Some of them can be dispatched of by a jump on their heads. 

The main difference to the other versions of this game is a unique level design. There is also a life meter which allows to get hit more often before dying.</desc>

		<name>The Addams Family : Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt</name>
		<desc>The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a side-scrolling platformer based on the second animated TV series The Addams Family (1992). The entire Addams family is being held captive by various monsters throughout the mansion, and Pugsley needs to rescue them. They are hidden in various parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest, which can be accessed in any order. The gameplay follows the usual platforming standards: Pugsley moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies.

This version of the game is heavily based on the SNES version of The Addams Family - it features the same storyline with another main character and almost identical level design. Another difference to the SNES version of this game is that Pugsley can only take two hits before dying - but there is an additional power-up that makes him faster and gives him an extra hit.</desc>

		<desc>Unlike its namesake on computers, this version of DragonStrike is a straight action game with a top-down perspective. Set during the War of the Lance in the Dragonlance world of Krynn, the player controls dragons in missions against the forces of evil.

At the start of the game, one of three dragons can be selected (Bronze, Silver and Gold), each with different attributes in speed and armor and two different breath attacks. In each of the more than 12 missions, several objectives must be completed: enemy dragons must be hunted down, ships sunk and fortresses destroyed. The dragon can change between low and high altitudes to avoid obstacles and enemy fire and to attack certain types of enemies: ground troops can only be destroyed from the lower altitude, dragons only from the higher one. Killed enemy dragons leave power-ups that grant temporary protection, speed, or let the dragon regain health. Some of the missions include boss battles against large enemies like a giant kraken or a powerful dark wizard.

In two-player mode, the second player (who can select a different dragon) can continue in the mission where the previous player failed.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons : Hillsfar</name>
		<desc>Play a would-be hero in the city of Hillsfar, where action and adventure await the daring adventurer. Join the local guild and complete missions from the guild master in a quest for glory and gold!

Hillsfar is a "single-hero" role playing game (in comparison to other Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPGs, where the player usually controls a group of characters). A combination of 1st person perspective (when traveling in the city of Hillsfar) and 3rd person perspective (usually in some action-style mini-quests) viewpoints.

As a would-be-hero, four classes are available in a randomly generated mission-based plot: Thief, Mage, Fighter or Cleric. Each class, to a certain extent, has a different approach for completing quests.

In Hillsfar, gameplay usually consists of various "mini-games" that are needed to complete the quests or missions provided at the local guild by the guild master.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons : Pool of Radiance</name>
		<desc>Located on the northern shore of the Moonsea in Forgotten Realms, Phlan was once a flourishing trade city. However, lately monsters began settling in it, gradually turning whole districts into ruins. Only New Phlan remained under human control, but its inhabitants are afraid to venture into the monster-infested areas. In order to clean the nearby Barren River and rebuild Phlan, local authorities spread rumors about alleged riches hidden somewhere in the city. A party of adventurers, attracted by these news, sails towards Phlan and accepts the quest.

Pool of Radiance is the first adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing system in a computer game format. In the beginning of the game the player can use a pre-made party of six characters or create each of them from scratch. Six races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf) and four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief) are available. The player can tweak the attributes of the characters and assign a moral alignment to each one.

Exploration of the town and hostile areas (dungeons) is viewed from a first-person perspective in a pseudo-3D world. Enemy encounters are random and take place on separate isometric combat screens, where player-controlled party and enemies take turns fighting each other. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies, and characters level up after having accumulated set amounts. Fighters gain more attacks, thieves become proficient in backstabbing, while clerics and wizards can memorize more spells to cast before they need to rest. Non-human characters can also "multi-class" (learn the abilities of another class) when leveling up.

The NES version was substantially different from other versions. It removed references to the Adventure's Journal and some of the more complex features of the computer versions, like different currency units. Battles were significantly reduced in size, the graphics were overhauled and redesigned so that the game could be controlled with a control pad, and music was written for it. A randomly generated dungeon feature was also removed.</desc>

That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to capture the Princess Leilani and hold her as his own. It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

You perform standard "adventure island" activities: ride various types of dinosaurs, throw boomerangs at snails, birds, snakes, and skulls, collect grapes and apples, jump over stones, and of course, ride your old trusty skateboard.

One day, suddenly a suspicious shadow appeared in the sky and kidnapped the dinosaur friends one after another. The animals of the island were brainwashed by the suspicious shadows, and the terrain of the island was completely changed. Master Higgins embarks on an adventure to rescue the kidnapped dinosaurs and restore the peace of the island.

Adventure Island IV marks a notable departure from previous games in regards to the gameplay, ditching the linear arcade-style platforming in favor of a more open-ended, exploration-oriented game with light RPG elements, more closely resembling later games in the Monster World series.

The basic gameplay elements are the same as in its predecessor Adventure Island: Master Higgins walks through the levels while fighting against various enemies. One hit results in his untimely death unless he carries one of the various power ups, e.g. weapons or a skateboard which improves his speed. He also needs to collect food to fill up his steadily decreasing starvation bar - death awaits if it hits zero.

A big addition are dinosaurs which serve as mount and offer different abilities, e.g. flying or shooting fireballs. Like all power ups these don't have to be used instantly but can be saved for later: before every level the player can choose the power ups he wants to bring with him. There are overall eight worlds with different themes which are represented by a overhead map. Sometimes there are different paths with other level and at the end of a world Master Higgins has to fight a boss.

		<desc>Asmik is not only a name of a game-developing company, but, as we learn from this game, also a cute little pink dragon. Recently, monsters began to invade the peaceful country of the dragons. The only way to stop this invasion is to contact the six Dragon Gods. Unfortunately, those gods seem to be asleep. So now Asmik must travel all over the world to find six magical splitters, that will help him to awaken the dragons and to defeat the monsters.

This is a traditional action platform game. Asmik can jump and exhale steam from his nostrils to turn all his enemies into eggs. Those eggs can be eaten and later used for various purposes (during boss battles, acquiring upgrades at a shop that becomes available once you have completed a stage, etc.). Asmik dies if he comes into close contact with an enemy. Boss battles differ from the rest of the game, each one being a mini-game of its own, for example a rock-paper-scissors game during which Asmik uses his correct choices to gain time to proceed to the next stage.</desc>

The fighting sections take place in both swamps and cities, where you can punch, kick, and jump kick the numerous enemies (and swamp creatures!) you will encounter. The shooting section can be played with either the Nintendo Light Zapper or the controller. You have a limited amount of ammo to get through the level, and if you run out you lose a life. In the driving section your jeep is armed with machine guns and grenades to help get past the many enemy vehicles on the way to your destination. There is a total of nine levels, or you can play in the practice mode which lets you choose to play a fighting, shooting, or driving round individually.</desc>

You control Dino-Riki from a top-down perspective as the screen scrolls towards the top. Dino Riki must shoot the enemies in his way as well as leap over pits and avoid obstacles. His chances improve when he obtains weapon power-ups such as fireballs or boomerangs. Angel Wings also help and let Dino Riki fly above the ground. At the end of each level, Dino-Riki faces off against a boss creature.

		<name>The Adventures of Gilligan's Island</name>
		<desc>The plot is based on a TV sitcom of the 60's named Gilligan's Island.  Your ship crashed on a deserted island, and now you must get back to civilization.  The stranded people on the island are: Gilligan and the Skipper ( the crew of the ship), a millionaire and his wife, a professor, and Mariann who is a homely Midwest U.S.A. girl.

Despite the name, you'll be playing as the Skipper. Gilligan follows you around as a comedic relief sidekick. The game is divided into four episodes; the goal is always to locate all crew members in a limited amount of time. To do so the two heroes have to navigate the maze-like island and collect items - every found character provides hints for the next step.

There are also a lot of dangers which have to be faced: wild animals and headhunters can be fought with your bare hands and fallen rocks or obstacles on the ground have to be avoided. A common nuisance are holes in the ground which lead to the underground caves: Gilligan is likely to fall into these. If this happens Skipper has two minutes to get Gilligan back. There are three items which help Skipper on his quest: bananas replenish his health, hourglasses give extra time and the rope is used to get Gilligan back instantly.</desc>

		<desc>The lovely princess Lala was kidnapped by the Evil Demons of the Empire. You are Lolo, a round ball-like creature (just like the princess herself), and your mission is to sneak into the empire castle and to liberate the princess.

Adventures of Lolo is a puzzle game, and each level is a castle room. The goal in each room is to collect all the hearts. It is not always easy, because some hearts are blocked by enemies who will shoot you when you cross their path horizontally or vertically (or both). Once you collect all the hearts, a treasure chest will open and activate all the creatures in the room, even those who were not hostile until now. You must quickly cross the room to the exit which is now available to go to the next room. The game contains 50 rooms in total.

The difficulty level increases with each room, and after a few levels there is an especially hard room with tougher enemies.</desc>

Unlike the two previous Lolo games, here you can wander around a world map and enter different locations in a non-linear fashion. However, some of the locations remain blocked until you find a key after completing another level. 

The gameplay is very similar to the one of the two previous games. You have to collect all the hearts in each room. Enemies will prevent you from doing that, and others will appear once you have eaten all the hearts and are hurrying towards the exit. The puzzles involve mostly pushing things to prevent enemies from stopping you.</desc>

He is the son of the famous swordsman Miyamoto Musashi and a skilled fighter himself. One day he hears of a rumor that the evil wizard Kojiro, his father's archenemy, has apparently reared up his ugly head once again! Kojiro's demons invade the land, and threaten death and destruction. "I shall defeat Kojiro!" - says Musashi, - "and maybe even get laid"...

Musashi no Boken can be described as Dragon Warrior set in feudal Japan, as apart from the distinct classical Japanese flavor demonstrated here, the games are very similar. Musashi travels over the world map, visits towns, buys weapons and armor, descends into dungeons, and fights enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a first-person perspective.

A mad scientist disrupts the peaceful universe and it is your job to visit various planets to re-establish contact between all the worlds.

The game is a platformer and on each world you must fight your way past many enemies. You can collect different weapons and additional health bars which will help you when you face the evil boss. With the main computer you can choose your next destination - but many puzzles rely on the usage of items found on a different world; e.g. an alien-translator.

		<desc>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is the video game adaptation of the 60's cartoon series staring Bullwinkle, a moose, and Rocky, a flying squirrel.  The game plays out much like an episode of the show.  The story begins at the dedication of the Frostbite Falls Rocky and Bullwinkle museum.  Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and Natasha have disguised themselves as security guards for the museum and managed to steal some of the priceless artifacts.

Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls.  Most of the action is of the side-scrolling platformer variety, but along the way, you will get to play lots of mini-games involving characters from the show. During the platforming sections you can switch instantly between the two protagonists. Both play differently: Bullwinkle can throw bombs at enemies and Rocky can fly for short instances.

This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</desc>

		<desc>The Federation of Intergalactic Powers is under threat by gigantic fortress spaceships which have suddenly appeared and destroyed nearby civilization. When conventional defense tactics fail, the Federation looks to find a specially selected person, Hal Bailman and equip him with a special "Lightship". His mission will to be to fly through the defenses of the eight known Air Fortresses and dock at the airlock. Then he must travel through the fortress in only a spacesuit to find and destroy the central core. Once the central core is destroyed, Hal must then quickly find the emergency lightship and escape before the fortress explodes.

The game is made up of two parts. The first part is a side-scrolling shooter on the surface of the air fortress where you must avoid various flying enemies and try to destroy as many waves as possible. This lasts until you dock with the airlock. Once docked, you walk the inside of the Air Fortress at your own pace. Hal is equipped with a jetpack rather than a jump as well as a blaster weapon and a more powerful bomb weapon. Any movement or firing you do consumes energy which is regenerated by standing still. Your goal is to blow up the core and find the escape ship before explosion.

Power-ups to increase Energy or Bombs can be found in each part of the game. Additionally, Super-bombs (clear screen of enemies) and Invulnerability can be found while flying the lightship.</desc>

The events of the game (and of the movie) take place in a futuristic city called New Tokyo, which is controlled by corrupted military and rival gangs. You control Kaneda, the leader of one of such guys, and the main character in the movie. Kaneda's childhood friend, Tetsuo, is injured during the highway chase, and taken by the military. While trying to free your friend, you find out a strange power is growing inside him...

The game is a traditional Japanese adventure. Instead of a menu with set commands, you have different options on each screen. After watching a cutscene or scrolling through a dialogue, you have several options to choose from. In many situations, some options will lead to Kaneda's death or imprisonment, which is Game Over. There are no real puzzles or anything of the sort, but if you choose the "examine" option which is available on most screens, you can move the cursor around the screen and choose what exactly you want to examine.</desc>

		<name>Al Unser Jr. Turbo Racing</name>
		<desc>Unlike its namesake, the IndyCar racer  Al Unser Jr., this game depicts Formula 1 races. A season consists of sixteen races, each one consisting of unlimited practice, one qualifying lap and the real race (the starting position depends on the qualifying result). Of course the goal is to win the championship by having successful race results. Those results also change the amount of "set-up points", which represent the quality of the car, players can use before the next race. Besides the championship there is also a time trial mode available (with or without AI opponents).

While the game features manual gear switching, it tends more to an action oriented gameplay than a simulation: pit stops (needed when the car gets nearly destroyed after accidents) stop the time for every driver and players can use a limited amount of turbo boosts. Players can start their own racing team or play as Al Unser Jr., which results in always having the best car possible.</desc>

The player controls Aladdin, who must make his way through several levels based on locations from the movie: from the streets and rooftops of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders and the Sultan's dungeon to the final confrontation in Grand Vizier Jafar's palace. The Sultan's guards and also animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can defend himself with his sword or by throwing apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect gems which can be traded for lives and continues with a traveling trader. Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives. In Abu's bonus round, the player controls the little monkey who has to catch bonus items that fall from the sky, but without touching any of the unwanted objects like rocks and pots.

The game's humorous animations were created by Walt Disney Feature Animation.

The game provides eight colorful opponents to race against, each of whom is supposed to have distinct advantages in a race.

After a certain distance, the perspective shifts to third person and the driver in the lead occupies the top half of the screen while the driver in second is relegated to half of the lower screen. Occasionally, the game also employs an overhead view. To add to the challenge, the game's cars have 6-speed manual transmissions which players must shift using the control pad, but not while pressing the gas button.</desc>

The player controls Ripley through a number of platform levels. She must not only defend herself against hordes of aliens and find the exit, but also save a number of prisoners, all within a tight time limit of only minutes per level.

Weapons to use against the aliens include a pulse rifle, flame thrower, grenade launcher as well as hand grenades. Ammo for each is limited and must be collected in the levels. The rifle is prone to overheating, so should only be fired in short bursts.

Next to health packs, Ripley can also find a radar. The radar indicates both moving aliens as well as the locations of prisoners.

After every two levels, a guardian level follows, in which an especially tough alien must be defeated to continue.

All-Pro style B-ball features several different play options. Go head-to-head with a friend in a one-game contest. Or, watch two computer teams battle it out on court. If you choose league competition your task is to lead your team to the league championship. In Two Player league play you and a buddy team up to battle the computer teams. Choose your squad from eight professional rosters - ranging from the New York Slicks to the San Francisco Bayriders. Each team has their own strengths and weaknesses.

When the scene is set, the game begins with a jump ball and then it's non-stop no-holds-barred B-ball. On offense you're the team - running, jumping, jump passing, shooting, and even going for three pointers or slam dunks. On defense make a steal or grab a rebound. And remember this is real video basketball. You get called for fouls and your teammates get tired. When their health and stamina get low it's up to you to put them on the bench for a rest.

In this form, you are larger in size, can jump further, and have increased strength. You start the transformation with an amount of mega points; each time a creature injures you, points are lost. When all of the mega points are gone you will transform back into your normal size.</desc>

		<name>America Oudan Ultra Quiz - Shijou Saidai No Tatakai</name>
		<desc>This game has two modes: story and tournament. Tournament mode is the simpler one: you compete against seven opponents in a quiz that concerns various historical, geographical, social, and cultural aspects of United States of America. Some questions require you to choose "yes" or "no", while others present you a short list of possible answers, of which you should choose the correct one. The participants' responses are timed.

In the story mode, you can navigate the character you created (male or female) in a top-down city. Avoiding getting hit by the numerous cars in the area, you must make your way to competition halls and participate in quiz shows. More areas will be unlocked as you win the tournaments. This time, giving the correct answer is more than just quickly choosing a word. Giving an answer is presented each time with a mini-game. For example, in one of the competitions answering a question involves running through a football field and making it to the correct part of the touchdown area, which is divided into large "yes" and "no" sections.</desc>

The object of the game is to be the first to collect a card for each of the four colors on the game board. During each turn the computer will display seemingly random dots, then a pencil starts connecting the dots to form a picture. The first player to correctly identify the picture will earn a card for the color of the picture being drawn. As the picture draws, a dice on the screen will count down from 6 to 1. Whatever value is showing when a player successfully identifies the picture is the number of spaces that players game piece will move on the game board for the next turn. The color of the space the game piece lands on will dictate the category for the next picture to be drawn. 

Each game will choose four categories from the various options, which include: tools, man made, clothing, food, math, office, travel, music, things, natural, leisure, and many others. After you've mastered the easier skill levels, the difficulty can be increased which will present more complicated pictures, remove some of the dots from the picture, or eliminate the dots entirely.</desc>

		<desc>Arctic is an action puzzle game that describes itself as "active rail playing". Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage's features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.</desc>

The game scrolls upward as waves of enemies attempt to impede your progress, shooting slow and fast moving bullets at your ship.  Armed with air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, blast your way forward while looking for bonuses. Crudely drawn buildings must be shot or avoided since it is possible to crash into them.   While moving forward the game allows your ship to move as far left or right as necessary.  Finally, at the end of each level you will have to destroy a large enemy.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.
The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.
By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

A long time period passed and the dimension controlling force Doh has again come back to life. Occupying the huge starship Xorg, it has entered our universe from a different dimension. Mixtec, Arkanoid type spaceship, has lauched the craft Vaus II to make a preemptive attack on Xorg.

All the elves hope lies in one elf warrior named Christine.  Equipped in the beginning with only a bow, she proceeds to find the ring and restore her home back to normal.

This is a game that may be compared to The Legend of Zelda, though more linear in it's game play. The game is broken down into many stages, the goal of each being to simply find a way into the next stage.  Playing out in puzzle fashion, you will shoot all the enemies on screen, earn the hidden key, and find the correct exit.  Defeated enemies will randomly drop bonuses that can be collected; these items include health restore, increased armor, and weapon improvements.

Beating the entire game requires successful progression through 125 stages.

		<desc>Armadillo is a young cowboy from Texas, who is in love with Sheryl, the cutest girl of the state. But an evil organization kidnaps his sweetheart. The matters become even more complicated when the famous Billy The Shell also embarks on a quest to save Sheryl. Will Armadillo be able to rescue the girl and to defeat his enemies?

In this game, you move Armadillo around an area map composed of squares. Some of them are empty, while others represent locations. Once you enter a location, you find yourself on a platform level, that often contains several sub-levels. There are sometimes branching ways on the area map, and you are not obliged to access all the locations to clear an area. On the platform levels, Armadillo can either walk and jump in his normal form (dies from single enemy hit), or turn into a ball, which is invulnerable to enemies' attacks, but is hard to control: the ball follows realistic physics, bounces of walls, and takes time to stop rolling. During the game, Armadillo will also be able to find upgrades that will allow him to take an animal's form for a short time.</desc>

You are the only one who can save the world, but you need to be strong and to find comrades, such as cat-like fighters from a nearby town, to help you on your difficult quest. 

Loosely based on an animé series Villgust, the game is a mixture of traditional RPG with platform fighting. Every time you encounter an enemy, you have two options: combat and auto-combat. Auto-combat makes you and the enemies attack in turn-based style, without you being able to interfere. If you choose the combat option, a platform pops out, on which you and your enemies appear. Both your party and the foes can jump and attack in close combat and from a distance.

		<desc>Long time ago, an advanced civilization existed in the Solar System. But one day, a black hole appeared nearby. Many people were sucked into it an transported into another dimension, which they named Artelius. It was ruled by the evil king Sarbelor, who constructed a machine named Galax, which tore the dimension into lonely asteroid-filled spaces accessed by warp points. The peace-loving scientist Dr. Rado built you, a cyborg who can travel through space, and entrusted you with the mission of finding and destroying Sarbelor.

This game is an action RPG. You navigate the hero in top-down view through space; chains of asteroids represent inaccessible areas on the map. You travel between various space areas by approaching warp points. The enemies randomly appear on the screen around you. When you contact an enemy, a battle begins. Battles are viewed from first person perspective; you are in control of a cross-hair, which you must move around the screen and press the fire button when you place it over the enemy. There are also special attacks at your disposal, which require weapon points (WP). Winning the battles gives you experience points, allowing you to gain levels ("classes") and become stronger.</desc>

		<name>Astro Robo Sasa</name>
		<desc>This is a shooting game with a twist. You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. 

The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.</desc>

As in its role model, you fly towards the screen or run on the ground, rendered in a checkered 3D field. The hero has been replaced with a uniform-clad schoolgirl, who must shoot down enemies which come flying, jumping or crawling towards her. The enemies are no longer spaceships, asteroids or dragons. Instead, they are various cute and furry animals, such as kangaroos, cacti with sweatbands, turtles and flies. The end-of-level dragons are also decidedly cuter, with the first level boss being a fluffy koala. Attack Animal Gakuen is one of few Famicom games to support the 3D glasses (like Space Harrier 3D for the Master System), though it is perfectly playable without glasses.</desc>

The game is a side-scrolling platform jumping game where the main method of stopping the killer tomatoes is to jump on them. From that they'll either splatter, run away or transform into smaller tomato bits. Energy Power-ups exist to refill Chad's health.</desc>

For example, Cannon fires powerful and rapid blasts, but you can only shoot directly in front of you; Van covers several directions, but has slow speed; Anti builds a protective shield around you each time you shoot, but its range is very small, and so on. You can change the weapons every time you are killed, before you run out of lives and lose the game. Typically, at the end of a level you'll have to face a boss enemy.</desc>

The hero must escape the various rooms of the biblical structure while collecting treasure.

In each of these rooms, the player has a limited number of times that they can pick up these building blocks. The player must also avoid touching roaming enemies like flying bats, golems and the priest guards. When the explorer gets stuck or the level is made unsolvable by a series of wrong actions, a button can be used to kill the main character and reset the room.</desc>

LJN's game differs completely from the computer versions, and plays as a literal race against time broken up by brief arcade minigames. In the main game, the player controls Marty in an overhead view as he runs down the streets of 1950s Hill Valley.  A collection of period-appropriate bad guys block his path, including bullies, hula hoop girls, bumblebees, and park benches.  The camera scrolls forward at a fixed speed, so the player must keep Marty on the move and away from obstacles. Hitting one causes Marty to fall and lose a life. The player must also collect clocks scattered on the street to stop Marty's photograph from fading away.  If it fades completely, Marty is erased from existence.

Street running sections lead to three minigames. In these, Marty must sling milkshakes at oncoming bullies, deflect kisses (shown as hearts) from his mother, and collect notes to rock out on stage at the high school dance. The final stage resembles the street sections, as the player must control the DeLorean time machine and collect enough energy to travel through time (shown as lightning bolts instead of clocks).</desc>

Bad News Baseball is a Japanese import for a younger audience. The game has two leagues - the Ultra and Super leagues - with 12 teams that represent major league cities which use fictional team and player names. There are several modes to choose from at the start of the game. You can play a One Player tournament versus the computer: pick a team and play against every other team once. Or, you can play a three-game series against a friend. There's also an all-star mode, which enables you to build a 23-player team from the rosters of one of the leagues. And if you want to watch a game, there's a spectator mode.</desc>

Kicks and punches are your basic moves at first, but as the game progresses and you advance levels, new moves and attacks become available, and new people to beat up as well. It's public mayhem way before the likes of Grand Theft Auto.</desc>

		<desc>Baken Hisshou Gaku: Gate In (or "Horse Betting Certain Victory School: Gate In") is a horse racing simulation game for the NES/Famicom. The idea is that there are a large number of parameters that you can adjust, such as how long a race is, where it is held, the lineage of the horses, the natural temperament of the horses, and so on. After setting as many parameters as you like, you can start the race and see which horse wins. There is no winning or losing from your perspective (none of the horses are "yours", and you don't get to place any bets or anything), you just change parameters and see what happens. The idea is that this game will teach you how to do well at betting on horse racing by letting you play with parameters and experiment to find what are considered the important conditions that determine what makes a horse do well in a race. There are no ending credits or anything, there is no condition to "beat the game". There are no seasons. It is simply adjust parameters and start the race, repeat ad nauseam.</desc>

There are four characters in the game which are controlled by players or computer. The turns of the game are determined by a roll of dice. The characters are located on a city map, and move around it according to the number that their dice rolled, somewhat similarly to monopoly-type board games. Each time you stop, you access a location where various things happen: you can select theater pieces and perform on stage, try to impress people, etc. Sometimes you land on a location that leads to a mini-game (swimming, playing ball, and others). Winning such a game gives an additional boost to your career.</desc>

For example, at the beginning you'll be in school and will have to solve simple mathematical exercises. After that, you are presented with a calendar, which is your board in the game. You cannot control the actions of the characters, but depending on the way you have created them, and on the day the game will randomly choose for you, events will occur in their life, some of which are completely ordinary (like going out and meeting someone), while others will grant your characters more intelligence, physical condition, or let them earn or spend money. The game will also determine what personal relationship the characters will have with each other, and whether a romantic involvement is possible.</desc>

A roll of dice determines how many moves the character will make. Depending on the circle the character steps on, different things will occur. Random circles will take you to a journey or depict a simple day spent with your family. Others will add money to the character, or make him train and raise his physical condition, etc. The characters move over the entire board, living their lives, visiting school, meeting with each other, etc.

You move your character(s) through the game world (it doesn't look like a board, like in the first two games, but still works the same way). The amount of steps is determined randomly: a spinning indicator will eventually stop on one of the numbers, from 1 to 6, similar to a dice roll. Unlike the first two games, there are no special icons on the board, all you see is a usual neighborhood with houses, streets, etc. Random events will happen to your characters during their life. Most of those events will modify your character's parameters. For example, a school event will increase their knowledge, sports will raise their physical condition, etc. You'll earn or lose money depending on the event. Your characters will also meet up with each other, fall in love, and experience other events, good or bad.</desc>

Ballblazer is a 3D futuristic soccer-like game, where the player (inside a Rotofoil) is set on a one-on-one 1,155 square playing field (the Grid). The objective of the player to kick a floating ball (Plasmorb) inside the opponent's goal (Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human or computer opponent.

The Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards to player. When a player in possession of the Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push field and launches the ball. When the match starts, the player must move down field and attempt to gain possession of the Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended direction. 

The player should also be aware that the Goldbeams move slightly every second and the distance between them will shrink. The highest scoring goals are goals made when Goldbeams have disappeared across the horizon (Over The Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to steal possession of a Plasmorb by rushing beside the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game ends when time runs out or a player wins 10 consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, over-time will apply and the first player to score will win the game.

Scoring

Close-in goals - 1 point
Goals near Goldbeams - 2 points
OTH shots - 3 points
Players may steal points from each other by making goals. 
The total combined score of both players cannot accede more than 10 points.
A player winning 10 consecutive points automatically wins the game.</desc>

First, the mole cannot jump or climb up unless there is a ladder nearby. So you have to plan your route ahead, otherwise you can get stuck at the bottom. Second, boulders will fall and block your way. And third, you have a wife. You should first find her, and then lead her securely to the exit. The wife will sometimes make things harder, forcing you to find alternate ways to the exit. But sometimes she'll also be helpful, pushing away boulders and clearing the road for you. 

On every level, there is also various food scattered around, primarily bananas. You'll be able to complete a level if you have gathered enough of those fruits. You'll also gain superpowers from bananas that will allow you to skip level sections that you find too difficult. The entire game is played only with the four directional buttons. There are no enemies and you cannot die - although you can get irrevocably stuck, in which case you'll have to restart a level.</desc>

Control your shot to get the power, distance, and hook or slice you want on the ball. After you've made your shot the computer tells you what kind of lie you have as well as the remaining distance to the hole.

Each level is populated with animals and with living objects of the sort you would find in that location.  She can jump with the A button and throw crystals with the B button.  The longer you hold the button down, the farther each crystal is thrown.  She has three kinds of crystals, each of which has a different effect.  One makes creatures help her, one defeats them and one has varying effects.</desc>

		<name>Barcode World</name>
		<desc>This video game was released exclusively in Japan on December 18, 1992 for the Nintendo Family Computer. As the title suggests, it is a video game where players use a Barcode Battler II (a card-scanning handheld) together with a Nintendo-licensed Famicom-Barcode Battler interface that came packaged with the game and not sold separately. A special set of Barcode Battler cards with barcodes imprinted on them were also required to play the game including the "White Card" that enabled players to scan any barcode (especially ones found on consumer products).

Barcode World includes barcode cards that feature characters from many Sunsoft series, most notably Hebereke and Gimmick!, however using the White Card included with the game, players were also given the ability to scan a wide range of consumer products. Released during a period of great interest in barcode-swiping games in Japan, the game dates itself as directly from the early 1990s, however the game still functions today exactly as it did then and modern products may also be scanned in order to generate new content for the game (RPG-style stats and attributes, etc.).</desc>

		<name>Bard's Tale 2 - The Destiny Knight, The</name>
		<desc>The sequel to the popular RPG Bard's Tale. After your characters defeated the wizard Mangar the Dark and freed Skara Brae from eternal winter, all seemed well in the world. Fortunately for your employment prospects, the evil Archmage Lagoth Zanta shows up and splits the Destiny Wand into seven pieces, scattering them all over the land. The Destiny Wand has protected the lands for 700 years, and without it the realm will fall into chaos. Thus it falls upon your party to reforge the Destiny Wand. Also, one among you must ascend to the position of Archmage and use the wand to defeat Lagoth Zanta.

Bard's Tale 2 uses the same engine as the original with similar gameplay, but takes place in a much larger game world, featuring several different cities (instead of just Skara Brae). You can generate new characters or import characters from the previous Bard's Tale.

Long ago, when magic still prevailed, the evil wizard Mangar the Dark threatened a small but harmonious country town called Skara Brae. Evil creatures oozed into Skara Brae and joined his shadow domain. Mangar froze the surrounding lands with a spell of Eternal Winter, totally isolating Skara Brae from any possible help. Then, one night the town militiamen all disappeared. The future of Skara Brae hung in the balance. And who was left to resist? Only a handful of unproven young Warriors, junior Magic Users, a couple of Bards barely old enough to drink, and some out of work Rogues. You are there. You are the leader of this ragtag group of freedom fighters. Luckily you have a Bard with you to sing your glories, if you survive. For this is the stuff of legends. And so the story begins...</desc>

As the manager you build up your team by allocating a set bunch of points for batting average, home runs, running speed, and fielding ability among your players. Then, you customize your pitching staff by divvying up points for ERA, speed, right and left curve balls, sinking pitches, and stamina. Your managerial responsibilities also include deciding who's right-handed and who's a lefty, and whether your pitchers throw overhand or sidearm.

You can also play in the Ultra League. Ultra League play enables you to give your hitters and pitchers special skills, such as the ability to pitch balls that zig zag, or hit balls that explode on contact.</desc>

		<name>Batman : Return of the Joker</name>
		<desc>The Joker lives again in SunSoft's sequel to their NES 
original. The Joker has somehow managed to escape from Arkham Asylum once again, and Batman must fight him across seven stages to restore peace to Gotham City.

Batman carries a gauntlet shooting basic bullets by default. This can be upgraded with weapon powerups located in boxes throughout the level, giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary attack, different for each weapon. Batman also has a slide useful against most enemies and some bosses. 

Boss fights introduce a system where life is measured by points instead of tick marks or bars. In these sections, Batman has significantly more health, and can take many more hits when rumbling with these stronger foes.

Levels include a snowy landscape, moving train, military base, and sewers. Two levels require you to run and dodge explosions while vehicles keep pace in the background. Some levels also have Batman activate a jetpack and play through a short side-scrolling shooter. 

This game is one of the few Batman games that was not based directly on a movie or television series.

		<name>Batman : The Video Game</name>
		<desc>The NES version of Batman: The Video Game is loosely based on the 1989 movie. It is a side-scrolling game, with a blue dressed Batman fighting enemies such as robots, jet-packed soldiers, ninjas and mutants.

The game consists in five levels somewhat related to the movie: Gotham City streets (with Killer Moth as the final boss), AXIS Chemical Factory (with Machine Intelligence System as boss), Underground Conduit (with Electrocutioner as boss), the Laboratory Ruins (the Dual-Container Alarm as boss) and Gotham's Cathedral (with Firebug as boss) where Batman finally faces the Joker. Before each level, a cutscene with scenes from the movie is displayed.

Besides his ever trusting punches, Batman has plenty of weapons in his utility belt: the Batarang, the Spear Gun and the Dirk (a three direction weapon). Batman has an ammunition counter shared for the three weapons. The Batarang takes one pellet per shot, the Spear Gun two pellets and the Dirk, three. Batman also has an eight hit life bar, which can be replenished by collecting hearts dropped by killed enemies. The enemies will also drop pellet items (10 pellets per item) and bonus items (which will only sum up points).

Batman can also perform a "wall jump": he'll grab a wall when jumping toward it, allowing him to escalate some narrow passages. Batman has three lives and unlimited continues.

		<desc>Like Konami's other adaptation of Batman Returns, the NES version is a side-scrolling beat 'em up. Next to brawling action, it also features two sections where the player controls the Batmobile and the Batskiboat seen in the movie.

In the beat 'em up sections, Batman has to defeat a large number of enemies (members of the Penguin's circus gang) to advance. Possible attacks include punches, sliding attacks, drop kicks and a powerful 360° cape slash attack which will drain Batman's health bar. Gadgets to be used include a limited number of batarangs and a grappling hook. The hook is useful for many things: it can take down flying enemies, pull Batman up to higher levels, lets him climb into open windows and more. Hidden in background items somewhere in the levels are power-ups, including hearts that refill the health bar and extra batarangs.

Each of the six levels in the game concludes with a boss fight against one or more especially powerful enemies.

The Batmobile is armed with machine guns and bat discs, used to dispatch the enemy bikes and cars in the driving level. The Batskiboat section is similar, except that there are no enemies and the only goal is to collect coins for extra points.</desc>

		<name>Batsu And Terry - Makyou No Tetsujin Race</name>
		<desc>Batsu &amp; Terry is a Japanese manga that follows the adventures of a pair of eponymous friends who are highschool students and baseball stars. The game controls much like any side-scrolling platformer, with a button for jumping and another for attacking. The main character starts off as Batsu, who uses baseballs to attack enemies with either an upward or downward arc depending on the direction held while firing. Upon getting hit by enough enemies, Terry takes over and attacks enemies with a short-ranged bat attack. Killing enemies with the bat provides Terry with more life, but the lack of range is a disadvantage.

The goal is to simply reach the end of the stage before the timer runs out. Most enemies can be defeated with attacks, but others must be avoided by jumping or running underneath them.

The game has a reputation as a "kusoge" (endearing term for a crappy game), explicable given its background as a quickie license cash-in. It has the subtitle Makyou no Tetsujin Rasu, which roughly translates as "Ironman Race of Demon World".</desc>

There are three fragments of love hidden around; Orpheus has to find them before he can enter Tartarus and fight Hades to save his beloved Helene.

		<desc>You are bee number 52, and you need to collect enough honey every day to fill your quota. But the backyard can be a dangerous place for a bee! Spiders, grasshoppers, assorted bugs, and even lawn sprinklers are all over the place and try to stop bee 52 from reaching the many flowers where honey can be collected. Even after collecting honey, you may need to defend your nest against ants who will try to sneek in and steal honey from you. Bee 52 is armed, however, and can sting or shoot many of the enemies that get in the way. Some levels even have bugs that, when shot, will provide bee 52 with more powerful firepower temporarily. Bee 52 is a side scrolling shooter which can be played by one or two players.</desc>

When you land on your spot, if it is just a regular spot, you play an action game for points, upgraded or better weapons, hearts, etc. If the space you land on has a red circle, you spin again. If the space you land on has a red circle connected to another red circle by dashes, you move forward or backwards to the second circle. If the space has a red circle with a question mark in it, you take a pop quiz of  three trivia questions then get to select either a key, a heart or move ahead one, two, three or four spaces. 

When you spin, if you don't get a number but instead get the book, you get a pop quiz of three questions. If you get the happy face, something good happens like move ahead ten space, get a key, get a heart, etc. If you get the sad face, something bad happens like lose your turn, move back 1 space and lose turn, etc. 

When you take a quiz, if you answer all three questions right, you get a star.

At the end of the game, a bonus is awarded to the player who got to the end first and/or got the most pop quiz stars and/or collected the most food then all the points are shown for each player.</desc>

		<name>Bikkuriman World - Gekitou Sei Senshi</name>
		<desc>The game is based on the animé series "Bikkuriman World". Once upon a time, the world was a peaceful place. Three races - Angels, Demons, and Talismans - co-existed in the world, protected by the Holy Goddess Nadia. One day, Nadia sent her twin children into the world. Jura, the head of the Demons, abducted one of the children and devoured it. The other child took refuge by the Angels and soon became their leader, known as Super Zeus. He led the Angels to a victory over the Demons. But Nadia, seeing how her world is being torn apart by the war, split it in two. Years have passed. You are a young hero named Yamato Ouji, raised in the world of the Angels. Super Zeus sends you on a quest to find other Holy Warriors, to re-unite the worlds, and to bring everlasting peace to all the races.

This is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. You navigate your hero from a top-down view on the world map, in towns, and dungeons. The enemies are random and the combat is turn-based, viewed from first-person perspective. You start alone but later you find other heroes who join your party and help you on your quest.</desc>

		<path>./Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure</name>
		<desc>Bill and Ted are two surfer-speaking 1980s high school dudes from San Dimas, California.  After the events of the film Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, they seem free to build the band that will one day unite Earth's people and bring about world peace.  Except...  Rufus returns from the future with a warning that someone has warped the time continuum by kidnapping historical figures and stranding them in the wrong time period (...sooo, basically what Bill and Ted did in the first film?)  It's up to the boys to sort out the mess.

The player controls either Bill or Ted, who have split up to tackle the quest (allowing each to leave items to assist the other). Each "mission" begins by consulting a phone book of historical figures, and spotting the page whose number has changed (a second number, flashing in red).  The player dials that number, and guides the phone booth through the circuits of time. Rufus could only lend a payphone, so players will need to plot out the shortest path to their destination, while avoiding any hazards. Each change in direction costs one coin.

Once in the target time period, the player controls Bill or Ted through an isometric view as they search for the displaced historical figure.  The player must stick to a defined path to avoid falling, and must be cautious of the locals.  Some will offer clues or helpful items, while others demand a coin if bumped into.  Other locals will actively chase Bill and Ted and throw them in jail, where they must use a skeleton key (if they have one) to escape. Players can find and collect coins for the phone booth, keys for the jail, and distractions (like pudding or tape players) to throw off any pursuers.

The player must also locate an item of "historical bait," appropriate to the target, to get them to follow. Once the historical dude has been baited and bagged, the player switches to the other member of the titular duo to rescue a new historical celebrity. The process repeats until time is corrected.</desc>

You have to reach the top of the level in such a way that the two penguins will arrive at the top square at the same time, coming from opposite sides. Enemies such as spiders will put web on your way or attack you. You can kill them for points. There are various power-ups that appear randomly on the levels. You should also be careful not to run out of time.</desc>

It has to traverse those platform levels to defeat or avoid various enemies. The way the baby deals with the enemies is quite unusual: it inflates them. When inflated, the enemies lose control and begin to float, until they finally explode. The baby can use this to its advantage, riding the enemies while they are floating, kicking them to various directions, making them bounce off walls, using them as projectiles to hit other enemies, etc. Such strategies are necessary when dealing with the bosses you encounter. There are various items scattered through the levels, such as milk, which restores your health completely.</desc>

The only hope to save the beloved Earth lies with you, a young warrior named Dan. You are sent in a time machine to the year 1999, when the monster invasion was beginning. Your task is to find your way through monster-infested labyrinths and to defeat the Increaser – whatever he (or it) is.

The game is an action platformer with more emphasis on exploration than on "jump &amp; run" gameplay. You don't die immediately if a monster touches you, but have a life bar that gets gradually depleted as you are hit. Defeated enemies bring you energy points, which you can spend to buy upgrades. You start with a sword, but later obtain other weapons as well. The game's structure is not entirely linear; many areas have different doors leading to different places.</desc>

		<desc>Bo Jackson was the first all-star athlete in two major sports, Baseball and American Football. Bo Jackson Baseball is a game about Bo Jackson baseball career. This game plays lake a standard baseball nine (or 5 – 8 if you wish) innings baseball game. There are three difficulty levels giving access to players at all still levels. When pitching you are given 5 different pitch types that pitcher chooses by pressing the correct directional button before the pitch, therefore keeping it hidden from your opponent. Batting is done the same way but the type of hit is chosen as the batter hits the ball.

At any moment, base sneaking can be made (by the batter) or stopped (by the pitcher). Fielding is only done using the CPU, but once the fielder gets the ball then you must choose what base to throw to using the directional buttons. All of the teams are just city names and players, all with different stats, are fictional except for Bo Jackson himself who is hidden in the game.</desc>

In a desperate attempt, you decide to walk to king Ogreth's castle and to defeat him. You hope you'll be able to find some way to bring your soldiers back to you...

In this strategy game, your goal sounds simple – just walk a distance of 600 meters and defeat king Ogreth. But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand.</desc>

		<desc>Bomberman was a robot in a bomb making factory who longed for his freedom. Rumors circulated that escaping to the surface would allow the robot to become human. Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.

The first of the Bomberman series. Bomberman is a single player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, you only have a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (4 directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up.. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</desc>

But Black Bomberman knocked White Bomberman to the ground, and than left the money so that he would be framed. Now Bomberman has been taken to jail and must fight his way out of this place using the only method he knows: explosive bombs.

Bomberman is the second Bomberman game in the series and plays similar to the first, only all gameplay has been reduced to a single screen. Your goal however remains the same on a smaller playing area. You are to destroy all enemies on a level and then find the exit to the next one. Bombing the exit is always a bad idea. The occasional power-up will increase your bomb blast, number of bombs on the screen at one time, player speed or give you the ability to walk through walls.

In addition to the single Player game, Bomberman II introduces a Versus Mode for 2 players and a Battle Mode for 3. Your goal in these is to destroy the other players while staying alive yourself.

Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</desc>

They can also pick up special items that increase their points, speed and attack power. This game features 80 levels, all-new enemies, and bonus mini-games.

Burai Fighter uses a slightly different gameplay mechanic when compared to other shooters. You can shoot in 8 directions, and when you hold down the fire button you keep shooting in that direction.</desc>

If the player performs well enough at the Olympics, they can go back home with either a bronze, silver, or even a gold medal.
When fighting in the Judo matches, the goal is to throw your opponent to the ground for a takedown. When in a fight, there are meters that the player has to be aware of. They are the power meter which measures the fighters current strength and the chance meter which measures the likelihood the player will be able to throw down their opponent. After each match, the player can choose whether to build up their character's strength, technique, or stamina.</desc>

		<desc>The Mandarin has knocked out Iron Man and the Vision. This time it is personal.

You play as Captain America or Hawkeye. In the one player mode, you must fight your way through various thugs to rescue Iron Man and the Vision. This game is a side scroller, somewhat reminiscent of Bionic Commando in which you fight through a level then move to an overhead map to decide where to go next. In between levels, Wasp gives you hints.

Captain America's attacks are: when he is standing, shield throw; when he is crouching, punch and when he is jumping, kick. Also, if you push twice in a direction, Cap can do a powerful forward charge with his shield for a short distance.

Hawkeye's attacks are all arrow shots. He can shoot left, right, up, upper-left or upper-right.

If you complete an area with one character then complete it with the other character right away, you can press start to switch between Cap or Hawkeye. This has the advantage that Cap's forward charge is powerful and by grabbing poles, he can then jump to areas Hawkeye cannot.

Hawkeye can shoot enemies or targets too high for Cap to jump up and kick.

In the battle mode, this is a two player, one-on-one battle. Player one chooses from Captain America or Hawkeye (the good guys) and player two chooses from Wizard, Ultron or Crossbones (the bad guys).

You fight each other until one player has won three rounds.</desc>

		<name>Captain Comic : The Adventure</name>
		<desc>"You are Captain Comic, galactic hero. Your mission is to recover three treasures from the planet Omsoc, which have been stolen away and hidden on the remote planet of Tambi."

Captain Comic is a platformer featuring a huge nonlinear playfield divided into several different terrains. As Comic, you must search throughout Tambi for power ups and items that will aid you in your quest to recover the three treasures. The Captain's main weapon is 'Blastola Cola', a can of drink that allows him to hurl fireballs at his foes. For each can that he finds, an additional fireball can be thrown.

There are many different paths that are available from the start, but without the right item or weapon, it can be impossible to progress through certain paths, or even to commit suicide. It's up to the player to decide the correct route to take, and which places to return to at a later time.</desc>

		<name>Captain Planet and the Planeteers</name>
		<desc>Based on the cartoon series of the same name, Captain Planet and the Planeteers are environmental protectors. Each Planeteer is endowed with a special elemental power which is used to combat pollution, preserve the enviroment and keep everything ship-shape. When the Planeteers powers combine they summon Captain Planet, a superhero Captain Planet, guardian of the Earth, is summoned. The powers of Gaia keep watch over the world, and assign the Planeteers to where they are needed.

Captain Planet and the Planeteers is an action sidescroller game divided into two sections: Inside levels and outside levels. Outside levels usually put the Planeteers in some kind of vehicle which can move in any of eight directions on the screen. The planeteers can use any of their elemental powers, drained from an energy bar: Fire shoots a fireball directly ahead, Water shoots out a water wave, Wind lets loose a defensive air currents, Earth tosses stones out to the earth and Heart calms animal creatures. Touching an enemy or projectile results in instant death. 

Inside levels summon Captain Planet himself, who can punch or turn himself into a swirling version of any of the five elements. Captain Planet can also move/fly in any of eight directions and also can only take one hit before dying. Power-ups can also be found on these levels.</desc>

		<name>Captain Silver</name>
		<desc>In Captain Silver, you play the role of Jim, a brave young lad with a taste of adventure. You embark on a journey to find Captain Silver's secret treasure hoard, which is rumored to be hidden on an island in the Eastern Seas.

There are six scenes in the game. During his travels, Jim will explore villages, fight his way on board ships, venture through caves, and wander around tropical islands. In each of these six scenes, Jim must use his sword to kill cats, rats, bats, witches, skeletons, and other creatures that are waiting for him. When Jim touches, or is shot at, by a creature, he loses one of his lives, but when he kills a creature, he can collect some gold that they leave behind, which can be used to buy items from shops. However, rather than getting gold, enemies leave behind some gold containing one of the letters that spell the word "CAPTAIN SILVER". If Jim manages to get all of these letters, he will be awarded an extra life.

Jim may only use his sword to start off with, but once he collects a fairy that floats toward him in every scene, Jim will be able to shoot stars at enemies, making his kills more efficient. The maximum number of stars that he can have is six. There are other power-ups that Jim can collect in the game. These include the "clock" power-up, which gives Jim extra time; the "boot" power-up which allows Jim to jump higher; and the "coffee?" power-up, which enables Jim to shield himself from creatures until he is hit by one.

There is a boss in each scene, which he must defeat in order to proceed to the next round. There is also a certain time limit, which Jim must complete the scene before it expires. If he does not, then he will lose a life.</desc>

After the vampire killer Simon Belmont destroyed Count Dracula in the original Castlevania (1987), an evil curse possessed him.

Unlike most of the other Castlevania games, Simon's Quest does not feature the traditional stages but allows you to freely roam the land of Transylvania in the style of Nintendo's Metroid. In several towns Simon can talk with NPC's and buy items in shops, adding a touch of role-playing.

The first level (or "scene") has you racing the clock to get to the front of a train, where a purple-faced villain is holding your significant other (or, perhaps just some anonymous princess). You have at your disposal a trusty throwing knife to take care of enemies. You will also have to dodge obstacles and jump gaps in the train. This section is taken from the earlier Hudson game, Stop the Express.

Scene 2 places you in an overhead, maze-like environment, where you once again have to fight the clock. This time though, you have to navigate your way through the area, in search of all the different "keywords", which are placed in different caves. Once you have cleared all the caves, the path will be open to the boss' final lair.</desc>

All of the gameplay is done from a top down view of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those changes.

The score are tallied up over 5 games to get the total score.

2. Eight Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit all the chosen set of balls (stripes or solids) and the 8-ball in one turn.  The score is based on how many balls where hit in.

In 1996, however, 1,500 copies of the game were located in a warehouse and eventually put on sale on the secondary market. All copies of the game were reused Action 52 cartridges, some with a small gold sticker reading "Cheetamen II". This cartridge is now very rare and hard to find, though numerous ROM images exist on the Internet. Dr. Morbis is out to destroy the Cheetahmen with all new traps and dangers. It is up to the Cheetahmen to make their way to Dr. Morbis' secret (and heavily guarded) laboratory to battle Dr. Morbis and his sub-humans (including the new, powerful ape-man). Cheetahmen II is a side scrolling platform game with arcade style action. There are three different Cheetahmen to control, a different one every second level.</desc>

		<name>Chip 'N Dale : Rescue Rangers 2</name>
		<desc>Following the first Rescue Rangers game, the Rangers' overcame the plot of their arch-nemesis Fatcat, and locked him up in the prison/pound. However, Fatcat's henchmen have sprung him from prison by blimp. Suddenly a television news anchor is reporting that there is a bomb threat in a local restaurant. The Rescue Rangers take it upon themselves to save the day only to learn that the whole bomb scare was a diversion in order to allow Fatcat to steal an artifact known as the Urn of the Pharoah. The team must track Fatcat and learn what he has in store for the stolen goods.

Like the previous game, Chip &amp; Dale's Rescue Rangers 2 is a side-scrolling action game where 2 players can play simultaneously as Chip &amp; Dale, or 1 player can control either chipmunk. Our heroes must conquer a series of oversized (from their perspective) stages in order to thwart Fatcat's nefarious schemes. For example, the first stage has the chipmunks hopping across the tables, chairs, and counters of a restaurant, and on through the kitchen. Many enemies try to slow the player's progress. The chipmunks' offensive ability is to pick up any of the copious blocks that litter the landscape and toss it in any of 5 directions (sideways, up, and diagonal-up). Along the way, there are scattered RR blocks for the heroes to collect. The other members of the Rescue Rangers -- Monty, Gadget, and Zipper -- are on hand to lend help out at key junctures.

It would, however, be followed almost immediately with Induction Produce's '89 Dennou Kyuusei Uranai; another fortune-telling interactive simulator.

The player can choose to receive their fortune in distinct areas of their lives, including romantic prospects, the best time to marry their partner and the outcome of their future business dealings. Due to the minimal impact and relative obscurity of Eastern horoscopes in the west, the game was never released outside of Japan, though the US would eventually receive their own equivalent with Taboo: The Sixth Sense.</desc>

Since you have a health meter with a dozen bars, it's not that important to dodge bullets unless your health is really low. But you should try not to hit too many walls. To get very far, you have to use your power-ups: TURBO for better acceleration, FIRE for more firepower, SPEED for faster speed, MISSILE to fire both missiles and bullets, and FORCE which lets you fire tons of missiles and also makes you invincible for a limited time. You have about one minute to complete each level. Speaking of which, there are 7 types of levels, each with different objectives. The entire game consists of repeating these types of levels, 25 in total. The later levels are much more difficult than the first ones. They are peppered with extra obstacles like icebergs, more mines, ...</desc>

		<desc>In "Columbus: Ougon no Yoake" you take control of young Columbus, who is dreaming to sail the seas and explore the world. You start at the age of 14, becoming a apprentice aboard an old ship, where you learn the basics of combat. Your ultimate goal in this role-playing-game is to discover the continent America, just like the original model Christoph Kolumbus.
The Game can be played in two different modes. Either in "Normal Mode" or in "Historical Mode". The only difference of the historical mode compared to the normal mode, is that you have a limited ammount of time to complete the game. You start in December of 1465 and the game then ends by the end of 1492. The time ticks off, based on the number of steps you take, what means that you'll want to keep your steps as low as possible.

The game provides eight colorful opponents to race against, each of whom is supposed to have distinct advantages in a race. Each race begins from a side-scrolling perspective as the 2 competitors speed out of the gate. After a certain distance, the perspective shifts to third person and the driver in the lead occupies the top half of the screen while the driver in second is relegated to half of the lower screen. Occasionally, the game also employs an overhead view. To add to the challenge, the game's cars have 6-speed manual transmissions which players must shift using the control pad, but not while pressing the gas button.</desc>

The difference this time is that instead of fighting from the cockpit of your Vic-Viper starfighter you'll now be taking the commander's chair and take strategic control of your entire fleet.

The game is a turn-based strategy game in which you must first assemble your armada and then take them into outer space to defeat the enemy fleet. You view the action from a top-down galactic map and success in each phase rewards you with further cash which you can use to buy more ships. The game will continue until the enemy fleet is obliterated (or yours).

The game doesn't include a campaign, but instead provides you with a scenario designer from which you select the AI difficulty, which side you will take (you can play as either the Gradius empire or the Bacterions) the map you'll play and away you go. Features single or 2-player Vs gameplay.</desc>

As the game continues, the player character can use different powers - some ranged - to take out enemies and progress further. Eventually, the player will have the option of becoming a metal-armored officer with considerably more fire-power, though this power-up state will vanish if too much damage is taken. The player character will also level-up after destroying so many enemies, improving their health and "cosmo points" - a stat similar to mana that is used to power the player character's special attacks.

The game's world is a network of caves that the player can explore for necessary items and bonus areas. The NES version expands this aspect, providing some Metroidvania-esque exploration. Some impediments are in place to restrict further exploration until the right item is found, as well.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 30XX, the mankind has exhausted all the metal resources on the Earth, so they had to travel into space in order to find more. They find a planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim.

But soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it's some kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans' main computer and get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure, starts its countdown.

There is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid self-destruction, aboard the "Red Warrior", and using your only weapon, an energy ball.

Crackout is an Arkanoid clone for the NES, but it's probably one of the most singular clones. You'll have to destroy all blocks but also the walls surrounding them, as the 14 letters are spread inside them, apart from killing the alien bosses here and there. In your way, you will find a bizarre mixture of enemies, from alien forms to parts of the body (eyes, lips, skulls...), who will make your game tougher by changing the direction of your ball; but also happier by dropping a sweet variety of power-ups such as the cherries (extra life), the clock (the enemies freeze), a rocket (to throw into the blocks), a fire device (the ball fires missiles), a parachute (slows the ball) an extra ball, or the weirdest of them all, the so-called Konami Man, who will take you to a secret parallel complex with different (and harder) levels.</desc>

While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:

1. Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.
2. Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.
3. Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.
4. Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire.
5. Falling "Crazy Climber" signs.
6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.

The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects,  another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. 

Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.</desc>

		<name>Crisis Force</name>
		<desc>The year is 199x and a robot army has invaded Tokyo City. A boy and a girl (who remain unnamed) board their ships to fight off the threat.

This is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up game viewed from overhead, where the player pilots a fighter ship through seven levels of intense shooting action. Each level hurls enemies and bullets at the player's ship, ending with a boss fight, except for one which instead is a boss rush level. The game allows for two players to play at the same time.

The player has a choice of two weapons; bullets or lasers. Weapons can be changed by picking up gems of different colors. Picking up the same color as you already have allows you to upgrade your current weapon a few times. The player's ship can change form and with it the way that the weapons work. This allows the player to pick the best weapon strategy for each situation. The player also has a limited amount of bombs that are useful to get out of tricky situations.

When a weapon is upgraded it also acts as a shield so the ship can take an enemy bullet without dying. This will however degrade the weapon down to the first level again. There are also pickups that alter the ship's speed and a special gem that, if five of them are collected, temporarily transforms the ship into an invincible super ship.

Crisis Force was only released in Japan.</desc>

		<desc>In the 24th century, the game of Baseball is very different. Tired of paying huge players salaries, the team owners got together one weekend and came up with a bold new idea, Robots. Indeed they renamed their league the Cyber League and stocked it with four robot types; Cyborg, Tank, Floater or Motorcycle, to play.  On an orbital stadium in space, these robots all play a slightly different variation of the baseball rules. Hitting the ball and catching pop-flys and making home runs are all the same, but when the call of a play is in dispute, there are no base referees; the robots engage in a one-on-one battle using any weaponry they're carrying.  Of course to make things interesting, weaponry (and other robot parts and equipment) can only be purchased with team funds during a tournament game, and team funds can only be obtained by wins. Thus the series closer is always sure to be a sold out game.

Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive.

Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives</desc>

		<name>Daisenryaku</name>
		<desc>One of many grand war simulations in Daisenryaku series, Daisenryaku for Famicom is a turn-based strategy with quite modern armies, the abstract "Blue" and "Red" countries (controlled by the player or AI), are at war with each other. Three basic phases make up each turn: production, movement and combat. Like in other Daisenryaku games, each side has to produce units such as infantry, several types of tanks, helicopters, etc. Attack is possible, when enemies are near.


 The game includes 30 maps with varied types of locations and terrains (islands, deserts, mountains, etc.) Each terrain type has different movement and defence values. This version uses "fake hexagons" for battlefields; the hexagons are in fact squares, with six neighbours. As opposed to most other versions, it has round-based combat, i.e. a turn ends when the player has moved all the units. It also has a less complex management system than the computer versions.</desc>

		<name>Daiva - Imperial Of Nirsartia</name>
		<desc>DAIVA Story 6: Imperial of Nirsartia is the sixth part of a seven part series developed by Toshiba EMI. The series is not a collection of sequential stories, but rather a presentation of the same story from seven different perspectives. Billed as an "Active Simulation War", each game has the player direct a different protagonist (or "hero") through a galactic war. In most versions, the player must travel from planet to planet, defeating enemy defense armadas, and then storming the planet in a mobile attack suit, destroying as much of the planet's defense systems as possible, all in an effort to take over the planet.
When designing the Famicom version of the game, Toshiba EMI took the system's capabilities, as well as it younger market audience, in to account. The game has been considerably simplified compared to its computer counterparts. Before starting an action sequence, the player is allowed to place three power-ups along a map of the stage. When the player reaches these designated locations, the specified power-up will fall from the sky for the player to collect. The game concludes when the player locates and conquers two specific planets; the Vuritora manufacturing planet, and Nirsartia.</desc>

		<desc>Danpei Ichigeki is a young boy who loves dodgeball. Danpei's father was a famous dodgeball player when he was still alive, and he joins the Dodgeball Club at his elementary school. However, these kids are very serious about their dodgeball, and the road ahead isn't going to be easy for Danpei.

Dodge Danpei is a team dodgeball game, one of several based on the anime and manga created by Tetsuhiro Koshita, which plays strikingly similar to the well-known Super Dodge Ball. Each team has four main players and three support players, and attempts to knock out the opposing team's main members by throwing the ball at them in various ways. Apart from normal throws, the player can also pass to teammates, and execute special power throws which are harder to dodge or catch.</desc>

		<path>./Dance Aerobics (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Dance Aerobics</name>
		<desc>Dance Aerobics is a chance to get fit by following the movements of an aerobics instructor.

Players use side B of the Power Pad accessory (a floor mat with 12 pads in a 4 by 3 grid) to follow the movements of an aerobics instructor. To succeed the player must press the pads with there feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.

The second mode is mini-games called Pad Antics that includes Tune Up, Mat Melodies, and Ditto. Tune Up is where the 10 of the 12 pads (the centre 2 been where the player stands) makes a musical note (do, re, me etc.). Mat Melodies is like Tune Up but the player is given a song to play and the player must memorise to play the notes as they come as every missed note loses points, get over 80 points (from starting at 100) and progress to a harder song.  Ditto is like a one-player twister like game where the objective is to place you hands and feet where indicated on the mat on the screen with 1 or 2 points scored with every successful position.

The third mode is Aerobics Studios.  Aerobics Studios is the same as the main game but with only 4 levels (Studio 5,  Studio 10, Studio 15, and Studio 20) all unlocked at the start, a score that counts down from 100 with mistakes (or up if the player is doing well), no progression in levels, and the player can continue playing even if there score is at 0.</desc>

There are 4 cars in each race, 1 or 2 player options, and 9 tracks to race on, with the Tradewest Speed Bowl the ultimate target, and is much longer but with double points (it's essentially a substitute for the licensed-elsewhere Indianapolis 500, which did pay double the usual level of IndyCar championship points for many years).

The player has limited fuel, and will run slowly if supplies run out, and the car can be damaged, although both are repairable in the pits. They get a turbo to use sparingly, which can also be recharged in the pits if they have bought more. After each race the player will get money (slightly more for a higher finish), which can be spent on upgrades such as improved power, brakes or more turbos.</desc>

Your mission is to make your way though the maze of rooms and return safely to your ship. To do this you will need to enter every room and collect all of the objects that can be found in it. Your oxygen supply is limited, though, so be sure to hurry! Throughout this world there are many aliens which will deplete your oxygen even faster if you come into contact with them. Occasionally you will find bombs or keys which can be used to reach previously inaccessable rooms on a floor. The game is played from two points of view; top down when in an elevator shaft, or side scrolling when in one of the many rooms. Some levels contain hidden rooms with many bonuses, or even an express elevator to get you to your destination faster (or it might take you back down a few levels.)</desc>

The game features many playable characters from the series (at least 28) and most of their transformations, with a corresponding trading card for each. There is also cards for varying versions of each single character, all with completely different attributes, statistics, and usable special moves.

For the PK Battle modes, each player must select a different team. He must then scan a player card (not a team card), and then that player will have a chance to kick a penalty kick (if it is his turn). For all other modes, the player must scan a team card and that will be the team that he will play as for the game(s).

The main mode of play is the J.LEAGUE mode. It is set up in a season/tournament setting, with 18 games per team. There are ten teams total in this version of J.League, and they are randomly sorted to play against a different team each day. The games are split into two periods with three minutes apiece. Prior to starting a game, the player can choose the formation of his eleven active players, from one of three layouts that he can see on the small screen (4-4-2, 4-3-3, or 3-5-2).</desc>

		<desc>Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. 

You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.

From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.

The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</desc>

Progress through the race courses in 8 U.S. cities, moving from west to east starting with San Diego and Phoenix. Each race consists of capturing a flag and finding the exit door, all while squishing or gunning down as many people on foot as possible while avoiding helicopters and heat seeking missiles that are actively trying to discourage this unique hobby. If the time runs out, a barrage of missiles descends on the player's car to indicate that the race is over.

The player has a certain amount of money to begin with and earns more money for completing the races alive. This money can be used to upgrade the engine, steering, tires, chassis, or weapon systems on the car.</desc>

Deep in the fortress is a gamma bomb, and your goal is to penetrate the fortress to destroy the bomb before it can be used. But be careful, for many Deathbots are guarding the maze-like passageways leading to the bomb! 

Gameplay is from an overhead point of view;  you'll need to find your way through the various passageways to reach the gamma bomb (located on the 8th level) and diffuse it. In addition to doorways and walls, transporters can also be found in the maze. These will instantly teleport you to a new location, and on many levels you will need to figure how to use them correctly to get past otherwise dead ends. Different types of Deathbots guard the passages; and you'll need to use the various weapons you find lying about to get past them, before they destroy you. You have a limited amount of energy. Each time you are hit by enemy fire or by a Deathbot, your energy depletes. Lose all of of your energy and a life is lost. And of course, each level ends with a large boss Deathbot. Good luck on your mission!</desc>

		<desc>Deep Dungeon III: Yuushi he no Tabi. Deep Dungeon III: The Journey to the Hero is the third installment in the Deep Dungeon series and the first to be released on the Famicom. This is the first Deep Dungeon title to offer the player a world to explore spanning multiple dungeons and multiple towns. It also allows the player to create their own party with up to three companions in addition to the hero character, with a choice of ranger, magician or priest for each character. Though the player can dismiss a character once the game has started, they will only be able to replace that character if they meet another pre-created playable character in one of the dungeons. However, the game will still end as soon as the protagonist "swordsman" character is defeated. This game retains the player-adjustable level-up stats from the first game, as well as the feature that removes randomized encounters if the player is at a significantly higher experience level than needed for their current location. One exclusive and rather annoying feature of this game engine is that sometimes the player character will fumble (remove) their equipped weapon, wasting that character's turn. If the player wishes to re-arm their weapon, it will cost the player another turn. This is the only game in the series to award the player money (Gold) when defeating enemies. All other games will force the player to re-enter maps to collect respawning chests for money or items (for resale) if they want to gold farm.</desc>

		<desc>Deep Dungeon IV: Kuro no Yjutsushi (lit. Deep Dungeon IV: The Black Sorcerer) is the fourth and final installment in the Deep Dungeon series. Unfortunately this game has removed the custom character feature of the previous game. Through the game, the player will meet up to two additional playable characters with predetermined class. This game also reverts to the standard practice or randomizing characters' stat growth when gaining an experience level. New to this engine is that the player can eventually learn to summon two monsters to function as a temporary additional party member for a single battle. It also removed the feature that stops random battles when the player is significantly more powerful than the enemies. This isn't as bad as it seems as the maps in this game are also much smaller (whereas the previous games used multi-floor dungeons up to 32x32 tiles, the dungeons in this game are either single floor, or multiple floors that can fit within a single 32x32 map) In this game, the player can accept "requests" from the non-player characters. These are optional tasks that will reward the player with bonus items, experience or money when finished.</desc>

A Stargate will transport the ship to any humanoid in trouble. There are now two special stages, the Firebomber Showdown and the Yllabian Dogfight, that occur every fifth and tenth wave. As in the first game, if all the humans are captured the planet explodes and turns all the landers into mutants.</desc>

		<name>Defender of the Crown</name>
		<desc>Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.

The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.</desc>

		<name>Déjà Vu</name>
		<desc>Deja Vu was the first game ever made by ICOM, the makers of such famous adventure games as Shadowgate and Uninvited. It featured mouse support, a multi-window interface, and bitmapped graphics at a time when text-based interactive fiction was the norm. 

In Deja Vu your character wakes up in a toilet stall of a sleazy pub with no memory of who you are or what you're doing there. To make matters worse, you soon stumble upon a very dead corpse upstairs with three bullets buried in him. Sure enough, you find there's a gun in your pocket with three bullets missing. From there you have to figure out what happened and who you are before whatever is happening to your brain turns you into a mindless vegatable. To make matters worse the cops would very much like to have a word with you about that stiff.

In 1991 a remake of this game was made for Windows 3.x, featuring improved graphics etc.

The gameplay is divided into two parts. You begin in the simulation mode, controlling your ship from first-person perspective. You can change your altitude, speed, and weapons, at the same time paying attention to the fuel you have left. Once you have defeated enough enemies and landed on a planet, the game turns into a side-scrolling shooter in which you must navigate your ship through arcade sequences.</desc>

A party is formed by selecting up to five officers from a huge pool, many of whom would only join you after be bribed or defeated in combat.  Officers in turn each had a certain amount of soldiers, which essentially acted as hit points (i.e. Si Ma Ye leads 40000 men, and when he is hit by Zhang Bao, he loses 5000 men, so his manpower is now at 35000).  One of the first games on the NES to attempt to simulate large scale combat between different forces, although obviously in a very limited way.</desc>

There are five different weapons in the game: hand gun, tommy gun, super punch, tear gas and Tracy's plain fists. There are also medical kits that can be found. Enemies can be armed or unarmed. If Tracy shoots an unarmed thug, he loses health.

The main goal of the game is to collect five clues; enough to be able to arrest the culprit. Clues are scattered all over town in various buildings, usually full of Tracy-hating thugs. You start by viewing the mug shots of known criminals, going to there last whereabouts and interrogating them.</desc>

		<name>Die Hard</name>
		<desc>John McClain decides to visit his wife Holly in Nakatomi Plaza, only to discover that she is taken hostage on 30th floor, along with a bunch of other hostages. The main terrorist, Hans, is after the money locked away in a safe on the 30th floor. His hacker, Theo, is slowly breaking the locks into the vault. It's up to McClain to stop them. Die Hard for the Nintendo Entertainment System is a lot different to its other counterparts. The game is played from a top-down perspective, rather than the 1st-/3rd-person perspective.

There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building, and the task is to clear each floor of terrorists. The stairwell, air duct or the express elevator is used to travel only to Floors 31-35. These are freely accessible at any time, doing away with linearity, and more floors are unlocked in "Advanced" mode). At the start of the game, John can only use his fists to deal with foes, but after bringing down some terrorists, several weapons become available, including the pistol, machine gun, C-4 explosives, rocket launcher, and flash bangs, using their weapons against them. When hit by these terrorists, John loses some life, but it can be restored by collecting soda cans and med-kits. The game ends when all life is lost. 

One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. Also notable is the "foot meter". It starts out full, but will eventually decrease if John steps on shattered glass or runs around at a faster speed. If the meter is empty, he will walk much slower than with a full meter. This may have been added in tune with the film, where the main character John McClain's feet end up in pretty bad shape near the end. Parts of the environments are destructible, most notably vending machines (receive free soda), glass walls and windows. Not all parts of the environment are shown on the screen all the time - a fog of war appears to shroud nearby areas in darkness.

The missions are time limited. There about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened (shown in the status screen), but more time can be gained by destroying the main computer on the fourth level. Once all the locks have been opened, there are only a few minutes to escape. Once this time expires, the game ends.

Like its counterparts, the game features cinematic sequences, which change the story depending on which actions are taken.</desc>

The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>

The pump can be used to inflate and destroy the enemies the same as in the original Dig Dug. At various locations on the islands are stakes, and when the drill is used near a stake a crack will form. If enough cracks become connected that section of the island will fall into the ocean, hopefully taking an enemy (and not Dig Dug!) with it. When all of the Pookas and Fygars have been destroyed, the game moves on to the next, more difficult level.

In fact, the game begins with a digitized sample of that quote. The game play consists primarily of side-scrolling action. Dirty Harry can punch and kick the copious thugs that assault him using their own fists, guns, baseball bats, nets, and dynamite. The hero can also pull is .44 and aim it in 5 directions in order to pick off enemies, but the ammo is limited. Further, Dirty Harry has a number of other tools at his disposal, provided he collects them.

This is not a one-way side-scroller, however. There are some adventure elements as well, such as being able to walk through alleys to other streets and going through doors to enter building. Entering buildings provides even greater challenges, like snakes and laser flooring. Dirty Harry even takes the fight down to the sewer.</desc>

		<desc>Players must play the role of a mother cat called Milky who lives in a dangerous metropolis full of dogs. The dogs want to kill Milky before she can rescue her son Michael who wandered out into the city on his own (and became lost). Players must catch the fish for temporary invincibility. However, the other enemies can still kill the mother cat like the fish merchant (who is the only humanoid bad guy in the game), the automobiles on the road, along with the manholes and the pylons. The city is divided into roads for automobile traffic and sidewalks for roaming pedestrian dogs in overalls. The fish merchants completely replace the dogs after the 30th level; causing the invincibility icon (fish) to become redundant.

Unlike the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of video games (especially the first NES release which would come out four years later in 1989), open manholes kill the player instead of helping her evade the roaming dogs. Sewer snakes also come out to kill the player with its poisonous venom. Triangle cones can momentarily block progress for the player. The game was targeted to a much younger audience than was considered to be "average" in the Nintendo Entertainment System community during that era. Using the classical music song Ballet des poussins dans leurs coques (composed by Modest Mussorgsky) as the background music, there is a common theme throughout the game of "dog catches cat; cat catches fish" - emulating the food chain.</desc>

It is the third such game to appear on the Famicom inside of a month, including Koei's Nobunaga's Ambition and HOT-B's Takeda Shingen. This game is based on the life of Date Masamune, who held power in Japan during the early Edo period. An outstanding tactician, he was made all the more iconinc for his missing eye, and Date was often called dokuganryu.

In the game, you play as the warring overlord, and your aim is the unification of 11 regions under one rule. While comparable to other historical simulations released around the same time, this game is a little simpler and features immediate battle scenes, a hexagonal map, and includes mini-games such as a gold mine search and horseback archery. The game keeps a light, almost humorous tone, providing updates in the game via the Namcot newspaper, which shows changes in conversation tone and the emotions of your opponents.

		<desc>In this game, you play a bearded dwarf whose girlfriend has been kidnapped and taken away to the dragon's castle, and in order to rescue her, you must defeat enemies with your mallet. Once you do, you can pick them up and throw them at other enemies, and collect the fruit that they leave behind. When you have defeated all enemies, you proceed onwards to the next round. If you take too long to complete a level, a winged devil will appear who will try to kill you while flying around the screen

Occasionally, power-ups will appear in the middle of the level, and these power-ups will increase your power, award you with different weapons, kill enemies, or freeze time. The more power you have,  the more walls that you can through enemies through. At maximum power, you are able to throw enemies through all walls.
If you happen to carry the blue hammer, you are able to throw it through walls, too.

There are five areas that consist of ten levels each. At the end of each area, you have to defeat a boss in order to proceed further.</desc>

		<desc>A couple is getting married at a wedding chapel, but the wedding is ruined when a bat comes over and turns the groom into a frog. The two dwarfs from Don Doko Don are called in, and are told that they must find a potion that will turn the groom back to his human self.

To do this, you must go through five lands infested by wildlife. Like the original game, you are equipped with a mallet, which can be used to smash enemies. You can then pick these enemies up and toss them at others. When you do this, they leave behind a gem that can be collected for points. During your travels, you can break open chests that contain goodies such as scrolls, extra energy, and more weapons. 

You exit an area by entering through an open doorway, but some doors are locked and must be opened with a key. At the end of each land, you encounter a boss that requires quite a number of hits to kill before you can proceed to the next land.</desc>

The objective is to bring peace to his magical land by controlling the famous fast food clown. Most of Ronald's companions have been kidnapped, and the animals have turned feral. His brainwashed companions will occasionally attack. Ronald can defend himself using apple bombs, thrown in a carefully calculated parabola.Being hit by the enemy causes damage, which decreases Ronald's "Life" meter. During various parts of a stage, players have the opportunity to collect up to 100 hamburger icons throughout the game. This will result in gaining a bonus life along with the hamburger counter resetting itself to zero. It is also possible to play a mini-game challenge, to earn commodities that the player orders from McDonald's.

Armed only with a can of bug spray, Stanley must force Donkey Kong higher and higher into the greenhouse rafters until Donkey Kong is off the screen and the next stage is reached. But not surprisingly, Donkey Kong isn't going to move without a fight, so he sends wave after wave of bugs, bees, and other creatures toward Stanley. Not only must Stanley repel the insects in order to save the flowers, but he'll have to keep an eye out for projectiles thrown by Donkey Kong himself. If Stanley is good enough, he'll be able to grab a can of more powerful bug spray and really get Donkey Kong moving. It all adds up to frantic fun that anyone can enjoy!</desc>

The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.

		<desc>Dr. Chaos was your typical mad scientist. He owned an extensive mansion and spent his time experimenting within it on things that mankind was never meant to know. His latest invention is an Interdimensional Warpgate which allows access to worlds beyond our own. As the doctor's younger brother, Michael, you arrive at Dr.Chaos' mansion one day to find the place crawling with strange mutant creatures. To make matters worse, the mansion itself isn't looking too good. Strange "holes" into other dimensions have opened up and made a mess of the architecture. Furthermore, Dr.Chaos himself is missing.

The game takes place as a platform game where you must use various weapons (knife, pistol, machine pistol or grenade) to fight your way past mutants and into various rooms of the mansion. Once in these rooms, the view changes to a first person maze...  and you'll need to open various cabinets, doors and hit walls in special places to find access into a dimensional hole. Once you enter the dimensional hole, the game once again becomes a platform game, where you will need to fight your way to the end of the level and defeat a boss monster of some sort to obtain a piece of the Warpgate. Then you'll have to proceed BACK through the level and return to the mansion, where you'll explore to find the next dimensional hole.

		<desc>"Hot Battle: The Androids" (the game's unofficial English title) is a direct sequel to the  second RPG of the Dragon Ball Z series. Following the events depicted in the manga series those games are based on, "Hot Battle" picks up the story right where it ended in the previous game: in the ultimate battle, Son Goku defeated Freezer, the evil Planet Destroyer. However, Freezer's brother Cooler swears revenge. Son Goku and his friends have once again to fight the evil in order to keep the miraculous Dragon Balls.

In this game, you control many characters from the animé series, including Son Goku, Son Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo, Yamcha, Trunk, and even the archrival Vegeta, who has now joined the team. In battles, you have three active characters, but you can switch and train them in between. The RPG system is similar to the one used in the first two games: your movements on the field and during battles are determined by the type of cards you choose from several available ones. The cinematic battle sequences are now more fast-paced, and there are many mini-games to speed up the leveling up.

		<name>Dragon Buster</name>
		<desc>"Dragon Buster" is a conversion of Namco's arcade game from 1984. The game is composed of several large levels, each one containing various stages: a cave, a tower, a castle, etc. Your goal in every level is to reach the final stage where you face the level boss. There are often several ways to reach the final stages, and not all stages are necessary to visit. Equipped with a sword, you move through the platform-like stages, clearing them of diverse monsters, collecting power-ups and trying to stay in good health until the level boss, since you can't heal your character between the stages.</desc>

Unlike the first game, you are not restricted to a platform here, but can move freely to any direction. You have to go through the maze-like dungeons, find a key, and then get to the exit. After that, the dungeon disappears and makes it possible for you to progress to the next one. You fight enemies with your bow. You have a limited supply of arrows, but you can find quivers among other items in the dungeons.</desc>

		<desc>In Dragon Fighter the protagonist is a fighter who can turn into a dragon. In this side-scrolling action game the hero can walk, jump, and slash with his sword. He can also charge his sword to fire a magical projectile. The real power-up, however, is that he can transform into a flying dragon. When this happens, the game turns into a shmup-style game in which the scrolling moves at a constant rate and the dragon can shoot fireballs in a spread formation. Transforming into a dragon is restricted by a power meter.

The game features six levels of action-- a snow level, a cave level, a water level, an industrial level, and a haunted castle level. The sixth and final level is fought entirely as a dragon with unlimited flight capability.</desc>

		<desc>Aeons ago, two dragons and their follower were fighting each other. The  "Black Mages" worshipped the three-headed Chrome Dragon, and the "White Mages" worshipped the glimmering Gold Dragon. The wars fought for territory and ideals where endless. After ages of fighting, the god Narume put the Chrome Dragon to sleep in the mountains and the Gold Dragon to sleep in the desert, to stop the wars. Then he took th magic away from the mages, and sealed it in the 8 Magic Books, which he hid in the sacred desert tower.

Hundreds of years later, three thieves stumbled upon the desert tower, and found the Magic Books. They split them up amongst themselves and every one of them, walked his own way. Now that the Magic Books were gone, the Chrome Dragon awoke from his slumber.  Narume then infused the Gold Dragon with the spirit of justice, summoning him forth in the form of a hero named "Feram"
Now it is up to him, to find the Magic Books and put the Chrome Dragon to sleep again.</desc>

The game is a departure from Dragon Slayer RPG-oriented gameplay style. It tends more towards medieval-themed platformer action. The hero has hit points, can buy items and weapons, use magic, and stay in inns to recover health. However, instead of receiving experience points and becoming stronger, you simply must attack quicker (by bumping into your opponent on platform levels) and jump higher.</desc>

		<desc>Dragon Warrior is the first famous console RPG. You assume the role of a descendant of Erdrick, a brave warrior of the past. Once upon a time, Erdrick defeated the evil Dragonlord with the help of the Ball of Light. Now, Dragonlord stole the Ball of Light, and your mission is to recover it and to restore peace in the world.

In Dragon Warrior, you move your character around in a top-down world. In cities and palaces you can talk to people, rest in inns and buy stuff in shops. There's a variety of weapons, equipment and armor to buy. 

When wandering around in the wilderness, you occasionally encounter enemies, and fight them from 1st person perspective. Combat is turn based: you select menu options while fighting - you can attack with your weapon, cast a spell (using up some of your magic energy), use and item or try to run. Killing monsters gives you experience, and, as is typical for RPGs, you level up and improve your stats when you gain enough experience. 

Like in later RPGs, you have limited hit points, lose them when you are attacked by enemies, and die when you run out of them. When your character dies in a battle, he is automatically restored in a nearby town.</desc>

Unlike the first game, Dragon Warrior II allows the player to join forces with two other characters, a magic-using princess and a wizard-warrior prince. Also including expanded monster battles involving up to 6 creatures and a much larger world, Dragon Warrior II is an important step in the evolution of the Dragon Warrior series.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Warrior III</name>
		<desc>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.</desc>

  The first four chapters are played from the viewpoint of one character per chapter, who will all meet up in the fifth chapter.  From a soldier to a merchant, the game weaves an intriguing story that ties all four characters together in the end.
  Also new in Dragon Warrior 4 is the introduction of battle tactics where the lineup of the characters is important to how much damage they deal.  The player is even given the opportunity to swap a character from reserve into the battle to add a whole new depth of strategy.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Wars</name>
		<desc>Dragon Wars takes place in the magical land of Dilmun, an island of salvation perverted into a world of horror by Namtar (as you might expect - the bad guy).

The player starts with a party of four in the city of Purgatory, equipped with nothing more than.. well - nothing. Worst of all your magic users won't help you out, either, because magic has been banned (to correct this unpleasing situation is one of your main objectives). 
Other main targets are surviving, getting out of Purgatory and toppling Namtar (maybe getting some decent clothing, one or two shiny swords and the like on your way out).

Gameplay instantly reminds of the Bard's Tale series. Step-by-step first person 3D, opponents materialize out of the air. The combat system is turn based.

Unlike its (spiritual?) predecessors the game features a full-blown skill system, auto-mapping and many places to actually use all these abilities.
Reasonable distribution of your skill points is rather critical.</desc>

		<name>Dragon's Lair</name>
		<desc>The NES version for Dragon's Lair brings Dirk the Daring in a side-scrolling game, different from the interactive movie gameplay common to the other games under the same license.

Once again, Dirk is up to rescue Princess Daphne from the evil dragon Singe. To do so, Dirk will use weapons such knifes, axes, fire balls, etc, thrown against dragons, bats, snakes, the Lizard King (who will steal gold from him), among other foes. He will also do a lot of jumping and ducking to avoid threats along his way, such as falling bridges, presses, spikes and holes on the floor. To complete a stage, all he has to do is to get to the end of it alive.

At the end of some stages, Dirk will take an elevator that will lead him to other stages. The elevator makes short stops at some platforms, and you have to decide if Dirk will jump onto that platform or another. If  he takes the wrong platform, he may go back to a previous stage and go through it all over again. From the elevator Dirk can also get to a bonus level, the Lizard King's throne room, where he can try to recover the gold the King has stolen from him.

Although Dirk has a life bar, he will instantly die if takes damage from the most of the threats. He also has a "candle bar", which is used (by pressing the start button) to light up dark places and to discover hidden items at specific locations.

The game can be played by 2 players taking turns. The PAL version has faster gameplay, additional enemies (including level bosses), death animations and splash screens in between the levels.</desc>

Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety - this is the Dropzone.</desc>

Play seven inning fast or slow-pitch games. In One Player mode, you face the computer in a five-game elimination tournament. Win them all, and you earn the right to challenge the awesome Amazons - All-Star Softball's all-time championship team. Of course, you and a friend can play each other in a head-to-head contest.

There are no preset ball clubs so you recruit 10-member squad from a roster of 60 weird players. Look for players who have strong basic baseball skills such as arm strength and speed. But to win on some of the tricky fields you'll also need players with more unusual skills - such as climbing fences, diving into water, and flying at night

In fast pitch, you hurl that baby in three speeds. But stay alert, base runners steal and batters bunt. In slow pitch, you can lob the ball short or long. You can also make your pitches curve right or left.Fielding the ball takes practice, but your guys can also dive for hard grounders and leap up to snare line shots. For quick double plays, infielders can tag a base then throw the ball.

With six softball fields to choose from, including the Sandlot, the Cliff, and a Professional field, there's some great action. Get ready to take yourself out to the softball park.</desc>

Gameplay consists of getting into your robosaur, tromping across the surface of desolate planets in the solar system, fighting meaner robosaurs, and equipping better weapons along the way (you can launch your dino's fist!). Once you make it to the middle of each planet, you eject from the Cyborasaurus and head to the life support computer. Destroy the computer and get out fast.

		<name>Eliminator Boat Duel</name>
		<desc>Eliminator Boat Duel is a ruthless one on one boat racing game that can either be played against the computer or a human opponent. The races take place in such settings as open water, the bayou, and even industrial water districts. Each boat race consists of several sections. First, there is the starting line -- where you can expect a $2000 fine for a false start -- which begins with a brief side-scrolling race with split-screen background scrolling, a common characteristic of later NES titles. The primary sections of the races are a mixture of top-down racing and 3rd-person racing from a perspective behind the boats. The top-down sections are the most involved with numerous threats to avoid such as alligators, sharks, and whirlpools that will turn you the wrong way. There are also ramps to jump off of, people in need of rescue, nitro speed boost powerups, and raw cash bonuses to collect. The 3rd person segments have less detail and distraction but move much quicker as the 2 players vie to stay within the flags, collect speed boosts, and hit the occasional ramp. Speed boosts are collected along the way and can be used at the player's discretion to gain a much-needed edge at any point during the race.

A race finishes back in the side-scrolling view. If the boats come through too close together, the bikini models on the sidelines act confused and request a slo-mo replay, which the game subsequently provides. Prize money is then awarded with which the players may use to repair and upgrade their boats with faster engines, tougher hulls, and better steering.</desc>

		<name>Elysion</name>
		<desc>Elysion, though a fairly traditional 8-bit JRPG in many respects (the first thing the player does is talk to the local King for exposition, for example), draws its influences from a lot of very different games within the RPG family: It superficially resembles the first Dragon Quest, it allows the player to select between multiple protagonists when starting the game as is the case in Final Fantasy, the combat system is real-time combat without screen transitions such as something like Hydlide or Ys and the enemies have an odd habit of only moving when the player does, such is the case in many strategic Roguelike dungeon crawlers like the Mystery Dungeon series.

The goal of the game is to defeat the evil demon Baal. However, the King first tests the player character by having them enter the dungeon beneath the castle and find a group of important quest objects. After completing this large dungeon, the protagonist officially becomes the Hero of God and can go defeat Baal by exploring the rest of the continent for some necessary magical scrolls and, eventually, special God-like equipment.

"Elysion" refers to the Elysian Fields, an ancient Roman underworld for honorable souls that died in battle.</desc>

You must hunt the criminals down and shoot them one by one. To locate a criminal you just have to follow the arrow on the left or right of the screen. Killing criminals is done by moving the cross hair over them.
A countdown timer will start counting down if a criminal starts shooting at you. You must kill the criminal before the timer reaches zero or you'll loose a life.
New bullets can be collected by shooting at the bullet boxes that regularly appear in the game as other useful objects.
The criminals sometimes take hostages for protection. Rescue these hostages for additional points.

Firing your gun is done with fire button 1 and deflecting bullets by pressing the fire button 2.

The game was never sold outside of Japan, or translated from Japanese to any other language.

		<desc>Far beyond our world, there's a world that resides in the books you read. But the five areas of the Book Worlds are in deep trouble! As Mamoru, a bookworm with ESP, you must go forth (with the help of a magical fairy and several other allies) to grab five special rings and save the Book Worlds from many perils.

This sequel to Esper Dream takes you as Mamoru on a mystical journey through 4 areas (one of them, the world of the original "Esper Dream", has already been done for you), each with their own problems that you need to fix. Like its predecessor, you begin battles (which now take place in different battlefields) by running into pairs of moving footprints - however this time Mamoru can simply run away from battles that are too much for him, or use a Teleport spell in enclosed fields. (Using this spell outside of battle will return you to the base town for that world.) In addition, Mamoru can bring along a friend (one per world and controlled by the CPU) who can assist him while battling and give him clues about where to go next. Mamoru can also carry healing items with him, for a quick boost of energy when he's running low.

The game ends when Mamoru's HP reaches 0 - or when you have saved the Book Worlds.</desc>

The game also features 24 different tracks from around the world to race on.

		<name>Family Circuit</name>
		<desc>Family Circuit is a racing game for Nintendo's Family Computer (known to some as the NES), hence the name. Unlike other Nintendo racing games at the time, it has many realistic traits, removing itself from the main crop of more arcade oriented titles. The car can be customized to your heart's content, with different tires, wings and suspension and detailed engine settings for both turbo and torque.

Four racing modes are available:

1. Free run: Run any way you want around the track, getting to know both the curves and straights as well as the settings of your car.
2. Sprint race: Race a season in four classes – novice, B class, A class and Super A – around well-known (Fuji, Suzuka) and less well-known tracks (Family Park, Namcot-ring), competing for the first place.
3. Endurance race: Run around and around a track to see who gives up last.
4. Spectator mode: Not a real racing mode, but allows you to follow any car in any class around any track.

As you bump into things or push the car too far, you must pit in, where you will be given statistics for each part of the car and may choose to fix it. Some of this realism is however forfeited by the fact that cars can never collide. Racing straight through an opponent with both cars undamaged is perfectly possible.</desc>

In the game, players take control of a horse, and help direct it to finish a track as quickly as possible by steering it, and wisely timing the expenditure of the horses energy in order to stay ahead of the pack without tiring too quickly. Progress is achieved by placing in the top four horses of each race. Prize money is earned by placing in the top three and by breaking course records.</desc>

In addition to the standard Mahjong mode, there is a tournament mode with a slight RPG aspect to it, in that the player can enhance certain stats after winning games in order to increase their odds in future rounds of the tournament.

The game is a one-on-one version of the game, less common in real-life Mahjong games but the standard for computer adaptations due to the reduced complexity of only having a single AI opponent. Nihon Bussan was responsible for Family Mahjong II's development and was at the time fairly well known for their Mahjong Arcade games.</desc>

In each game, the player gets a turn only after they've answered the trivia question correctly.</desc>

The fourth of Namco's lengthy "Family" series of sports games and the first to concentrate on tennis, Family Tennis plays much like its Nintendo forebear and other tennis game contemporaries. It shares the same viewpoint from behind the court and requires that the player make their way to where each shot is heading and return the ball by tapping the swing button in order to win.

Family Tennis has a few notable quirks, however. First, is that the many fictional tennis players available all superficially resemble actual real-life stars of the sport. The second is "Cosmos Mode", in which the action is taken to outer space. Besides the starry background and the astronaut ballboys, there's little functional difference however. There was also four female characters, of the sixteen total, who all had a bigger racket then the men. Essentially making the women into an 'Easy Mode'</desc>

You must destroy the large creatures in each world before moving on to the next. Your task becomes difficult by other small creatures that happen to pass by. If you destroy a large creature, they will drop a dollar bill, which you can pick up and use at the shop to buy items and powerful weapons such as laser beams, x-way shots, and big wings. Another way to get money is to shoot certain kinds of enemies all in a row.

More often than not, some large creatures will reveal a warp gate rather than a dollar bill. You can go through the warp gate to get to another part of the land, and destroy more large creatures. Only one of them will have a warp gate in the form of a 'stop' sign - that is your ticket to the round boss, but you must defeat all large creatures in order to pass through it. Also like in the original can you walk on the ground to avoid approaching enemies, and spend money in the shop to get new weapons (but they only last for a limited time).</desc>

Fast-forward to three months later. You are a nameless young adventurer, looking for some action. Your first task is... you guessed it, to rescue a princess. After the king gives you this assignment, you are free to roam about the world, visiting dangerous caves and towers, and fulfilling ancient prophecies..

"Faria" is a combination of console-style RPG exploration and character development (like in  Final Fantasy or  Dragon Quest) with real-time battles. On the world map, you are randomly attacked by enemies, and have to eliminate them running around the battle field and attacking them physically or casting spells. In the complex, maze-like towers the enemies appear everywhere. There is also a good deal of puzzles to solve in the dungeons.</desc>

You will be talking with the villagers, collecting gold to buy weapons, armor and other objects, jumping over obstacles and using items. Attack zombies, dwarves, giant snakes, wyverns, evil gnomes, or one-eyed one-footed things with a large collection of swords and daggers or zap them with a magic spell.</desc>

		<desc>Felix The Cat is a platformer based on the famous cartoon character.

The Professor has kidnapped Kitty, Felix girlfriend, trying to exchange her for Felix' magic bag. Naturally, Felix is not going to let himself be blackmailed, and instead sets out to free Kitty. 

There are four different types of levels. 

1. Typical platforming levels in which Felix has to make his way to the exit while jumping about obstacles and chasms, killing enemies using different weapons.

Swimming levels in which Felix rides a float or on the back of a dolphin.

Levels that take place entirely under water.

Flying levels that put Felix in control of different flying devices, such as a plane, a hot-air balloon or an umbrella.

Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat symbols to improve his weapons. After collecting a certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will appear. Hearts improve Felix' current weapon. What types of weapon Felix can use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons ranging from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons that are better than the standard weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting hit by an enemy decreases the level of Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the standard weapon, he loses a life.

The Game Boy version plays virtually identically to the NES version, but features less levels.</desc>

		<desc>Final Lap by Namco is considered by many to be the spiritual successor to Pole Position. This fairly straightforward Formula 1 racing game features a one or two player mode which is raced via split-screen. Up to eight players can take turns playing in a tournament mode. 

The initial race takes place on an oval track in New York while subsequent tracks with more challenging turns and corners will take players all over the world; from Mexico to Monaco. Each car can be upgraded before a race with allotted points to customize the tires, engine, brakes, and nitro. Nitro is kicked in by pressing up on the control pad. Colliding into competitors will bump your car back but sliding into billboards on the side can cause your vehicle to spin out.</desc>

		<desc>The peaceful island Coolmint is attacked by flame monsters sent by the evil wizard Druidle. The queen of the winter fairies chooses the novice wizard Dana to drive back the monsters.

Fire 'n Ice is a puzzle game seen from a side-view perspective. The goal in each level is to extinguish all flames by pushing or dropping blocks onto them. The player takes control of Dana who can create or destroy ice blocks, climb blocks and push loose blocks. Ice is created diagonally below Dana in the direction that he is facing, if there is already an ice block there, it will be destroyed. However, ice blocks cannot be created on a spot that is already occupied by a flame, so that the player will often have to find a way to create ice blocks next to or above a flame so that they can be pushed or dropped onto it. If an ice block is created next to another object or wall it will stick to it, meaning it can't be moved and won't fall down. It is therefor also possible to create ice bridges to get over chasms. When a loose ice block is pushed, it slides above the ground until it hits another object. Rocks can also be used to extinguish flames, but they are indestructible and only move one space when pushed (unless they are on an icy surface).</desc>

		<desc>In Fisher-Price: Firehouse Rescue, the player controls a fireman driving a firetruck. Both the fireman and the firetruck bear the familiar style of the popular Fisher-Price toy line. The object of the game is to rescue pets from trees and people from houses in the immediate neighborhood. There are 2 parts to this task: the first part involves navigating the maze-like streets from an overhead perspective in order to find the troubled residence. Once the house is reached, the second part of the job is to maneuver the firetruck's ladder underneath the person or animal in need of rescue, from a side perspective, and letting them down to safety.

While the first level confines the entire neighborhood to a one-screen maze, later levels span multiple screens, thereby increasing the challenge. Further, later levels also add time limits and additional keys that the player must collect before attempting the rescue mission.

The game has 3 levels, with each having progressively more cards (12, 16, or 20). The cards contain pictures of Fisher-Price toys. Finding matches removes the cards from the screen which then reveals parts of a larger Fisher-Price item.

The game allows a player to play alone, or it allows 2-player competitive play. Further, it also allows human vs. computer competition, where the computer player is named "Electro".</desc>

		<desc>Tsurikichi Sanpei: Blue Marlin Hen (lit. Fishing Maniac Sanpei: Blue Marlin Chaper) is a fishing simulation. It was published in Japan for both the Famicom and the MSX home computer in 1988. It is based upon the Japanese manga Tsurikichi Sanpei, which was written and illustrated by Takao Yaguchi. The manga was serialised in Kodansha's Weekly Sh?nen Magazine from 1973 to 1983.
The series is about a boy who discovers that he has a talent and a huge passion for fishing, and tries to to maximize his potential by entering into different fishing contests. He encounters all kinds of rivals and companions who help him increase his skill. As he faces various challenges, he learns to solve difficult problems and learns from his mistakes to the extent that he is able to fish anything out of the water.
In the game, Sanpei is competing for the top prize in the "1988 Famicom International Billfish Tournament" by capturing the largest Blue Marlin possible.</desc>

The game itself, however, features no story whatsoever, but a lot of platform action instead. You have to run quickly through the levels (there is a time limit), punching and kicking your enemies, causing them to fly away or to explode, occasionally meeting a boss, visiting secret areas behind doors and collecting various power-ups. 

This is in fact the second game in the series; the first one was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

Flappy must strategically take advantage of the gravity and the Red Stones in order to clear the path for pushing the Blue Stone.  Three different types of enemies will try to prevent Flappy from clearing the level, so you must either avoid the enemies, crush them from above with the Stones, or pick up Sleeping Mushrooms to knock them out temporarily.</desc>

		<name>Fleet Commander</name>
		<desc>Fleet Commander is a strategy game developed and published by ASCII Entertainment for the Famicom in 1988. It is the first naval battle game ever released for the system. While it supposedly depicts a battle between two fictional countries, the game is largely recognized to be a recreation of one of the crucial naval battles that occurred between Japan and the United States near the end of World War II. Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers, battleships, submarines and aircraft carriers.

A couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map using the plastic models. Second, no background music is heard while playing this game. Finally, this game makes use of a device known as the "Turbo File," which was manufactured and sold by ASCII as well. This device was a hardware add-on for the Famicom which was used to save game progress. It was compatible with a number of other titles.</desc>

Butler plans to feature the pets in his intergalactic zoo, and what's worse, he's destroyed the Great Gazoo's time machine so that no-one could stop him!  It's up to everyone's favourite caveman, Fred Flintstone, to find the pieces to the time machine and repair it, so that they can travel to the future and confront Dr. Butler once and for all!

The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino &amp; Hoppy is a side-scrolling platformer for the NES.  In it, you control Fred Flintstone through various locations such as Bedrock, Reef Rock, the Jungle and more as he searches for the missing pieces of Gazoo's time machine.  Fred has his trusty club which he can use to attack with, or charge up it's power by holding B for a more deadly attack.  Fred can collect coins after defeating enemies, which are used to pay for secondary weapons like slingshots and tomahawks, as well as special abilities such as flying and diving.

After completing the first level, the player is presented with an overworld map that allows you to choose which level you'd like to go to.  There are also basketball courts on the map - if you beat your opponent in a game of basketball, you can earn one of the special abilities which are required for use later.

The Surprise at Dinosaur Peak is the second Flintstones-licensed game for the NES. There are two characters you can play with. By pressing the Select button you can change from Fred to Barney and vice versa. Each character has unique abilities that are needed to complete certain parts of each stage. For example Fred can grab the edges of a roof or a hill and climb while Barney can hang from ropes and vines. In terms of weapons Fred has a bat which is stronger and can also be charged for extra power but it takes more time to use. Barney on the other hand has a slingshot and can shoot small rocks for ranged attacks but rather weak. There are also weapons like throwing axes and bowling balls that both can use.

		<desc>Itadaki Street is a digital board game similar to Monopoly, from the creator of Dragon Quest, Yuji Horii. Much like its inspiration, players take turns moving around the board, which is divided into districts made up of multiple properties. Landing on a property allows you to buy it, and owning multiple properties in the same district increases their value, but landing on a property owned by another player forces you to pay them based on the property's value. A key element is the ability to invest in districts by purchasing stock, even if the player owns no property in that district, which increases the value of those properties and gives the player a cut of any transactions involving that district. There is also a roulette mini-game, and a chance board there players can pick random prizes. The goal is to be the first player to amass a certain amount of net worth, then return to the bank. Up to four players can play at once, with computer players filling in any empty slots. There are 7 different characters and five different board layouts to choose from.</desc>

He makes a request that his subject Mark pilot the flying craft, called the Fuzzical Fighter, and go and recover this stone,

The main gameplay involves flying the Fuzzical Fighter through several side-scrolling stages, shooting at or using magic against the incoming attacking enemies. At the end of each stage is a boss fight. Defeating enemies during this portion of the game earns the player gold.

Between stages, the player visits different towns where they can spend the gold they have earned on different items in the various shops. Players can buy different weapons, engines, and shields for their Fuzzical Fighter to equip. Players can also restore the Fuzzical Fighter's health and magic points too.</desc>

		<desc>G.I Joe is a side-scrolling action game where you can select 3 out of a possible 5 characters to complete a mission. 

Each level is in three main parts:  The fight into the mission zone, the mission zone, and the escape from the mission zone.  The stages where you fight into and escape from the mission zone are straightforward action – just fight your way to the end of the stage, and defeat the stage boss.

The actual mission zone is a maze, where the object is to place bombs at pre-determined locations, then find and use the exit.  The mazes start out easy with the first one being only two screens high and 4 long.  Level 6 is 7 by 8 for a total of 56 screens.

Characters:

Duke (Tiger Force first sergeant/squad leader), Rock &amp; Roll (gatling gunner), Capt. Grid-Iron (hand-to-hand combat specialist), Blizzard (arctic attack soldier), Snake Eyes (commando)

There are an infinite number of stages to progress through.  Every third level is a "challenge stage" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.

Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last "life," you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.

A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final "hit ratio"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.</desc>

		<name>Galaxy 5000 : Racing in the 51st Century</name>
		<desc>Galaxy 5000 is an isometric-perspective space racing game where 4 spaceships compete head to head in outer space races. 1 or 2 human players can compete in the races; the rest of the ships are controlled by the computer. The ships complete several laps around each course and have limited firing capacity to throw their opponents off balance. The ships can also jump. In fact, the ships can jump right off the edge of the course and drop down (in space). If the player does not complete a course in good time, the entire race track will disintegrate and leave the ship to fall down (and apparently splash into some water below).

A notable item about this game is its use of squeaky, comical, digitized voices for exclamations when colliding with another player ("Hey!", "Excuse me!", "Watch it!"). There are also 2 completely different control schemes that a player can adopt for cruising around the course. The first scheme rotates and drives the ship in the direction that the control pad is being pressed. The second scheme uses left and right to rotate the ship and up to thrust in the direction the nose is pointing.</desc>

		<name>Rpg Jinsei Game</name>
		<desc>RPG Jinsei Game  is a Japan-only role playing game for the Family Computer that is similar to Jinsei Game, which is the Japanese version of The Game of Life.

The object is to explore a city full of stores, places of employment, and learning places. Starting from home, the player must earn money and statistics in order to unlock the better features of the game.

Unlike most games based on the Jinsei Game series, RPG Jinsei Game doesn't use a spinner system. Instead, the controller pad is used for movement and random encounters are featured like in Dragon Quest. The player can also talk to strangers who might either give him/her advice or do something malevolent to him/her. As in the actual Game of Life board game, the player has to choose from a series of careers ranging from a musician to a photographer and even a professional wrestler. Most of these tasks are mundane while one of the quests directly involves chasing down unidentified flying objects. Buildings that are crucial to the quest (other than shops and learning places) can be fully explored; otherwise the player simply talks to the resident.

Fights can occur like in a real role-playing game. However, the players stats are used instead of hit points and magic points</desc>

But his trusty friend Ebisumaru has good news: there is a big treasure to find somewhere in a big city across the sea. Of course the treasure won't be just given to Goemon: he'll have to perform a dangerous mission before. The two friends board a ship and thus the journey begins...

The game is very similar to its predecessor, as well as to most other console-style RPGs of the period. You talk to people in towns, buy various equipment, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat. The combat perspective is slightly changed in this sequel (over-the-shoulder view of the battle instead of semi-animated pictures).</desc>

		<desc>Garfield, the lovable fat orange cat, has gotten himself into a spot of trouble. His pal and center of abuse, the yellow dog Odie, has gone and disappeared somewhere. Their owner, Jon, is too lazy to go look for Odie himself, so he has Garfield go out and look for him. And so Garfield heads off, out into the world.

A Week of Garfield is a side-scrolling platform game based on the comic strip by Jim Davis. Garfield heads to the right through various indoor and outdoor city environments, dealing with endless vermin like frogs, birds, and mice using his judo kick skills and several different weapons such as bones that can be thrown. He has a life bar that can quickly deplete if he isn't careful, but hidden all around each stage are various items, which can replenish his health, refill his weapon supplies, and give him super speed or invincibility; be careful, though, as sometimes he'll also find fish bones which will harm Garfield if eaten.

The game is divided into seven stages, each representing a day of the week, and each with several sections. At the end of each section is a door, and Garfield must find the key hidden somewhere on the screen to unlock the door and continue. At the last door of each stage, there is a boss that must be defeated before Garfield can find the key. Each stage also has a strict time limit to keep him from dawdling, and between stages, Jon will appear to encourage Garfield or give him some advice.</desc>

Mission objectives.can be anything from eliminating the enemies to destroying the enemy fuel dump to taking out an enemy camp.  However dangerous enemies lurk all over the battlefield.  Helicopters, minefields and other tanks wait to block your moves.  These enemies can move off-screen and strafe around the tank, leading to difficulties.  

However, many strategic elements are involved.  The first-person mode offers a limited view of the battlefield, and if players push the tank into overdrive it can miss the target and rush into a nest of tanks or a minefield.  Turret angle, ammunition, and tank fuel remaining must all be taken into account by the player.  To add to this, certain guns on the tank (there's 4 of them) will only hurt certain enemies.  But don't expect any help here!  Six hits and your tank is cooked!</desc>

It featured a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior, has a  bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.

Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. 

Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level.
Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.</desc>

Players have control over their spaceships altitude while flying around the screen and can fire two different weapons. One weapon is meant for ground enemies while the other weapon is meant for aerial enemies. While the majority of the enemies are gun towers, ships and tanks that can be defeated in one shot, at the end of each round players will have to face off with a gigantic boss enemy that will require several shots to defeat.

Mode B is similar to Mode A, but now the camera follows the players ship's movements instead. This mode also features a fixed target reticle in front of the player's ship to help with aiming their fire.</desc>

Kagekiyo travels the country searching for his eternal nemeses all the while fighting youkai and other monsters. These fights are depicted as one-on-one turn-based struggles where the player and creature's health is depicted as candles. Kagekiyo can regenerate health at shrines by spending money and can also level up stats at torii gates by spending "toku", or virtue. Both money and toku are earned defeating enemies.

The game has a physical board game component as well. Included in the box is several miniatures and a fold-out board. Players use the board to move their pieces, but all combat is depicted in-game.</desc>

		<name>George Foreman's KO Boxing</name>
		<desc>Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds against different boxers to win the championship title belt.

Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.

By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.

All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.</desc>

In order to save a baby, Tokoro-san must traverse Tokyo, armed only with a water pistol. Cute nasties which look like fantasy creatures run at him and must be shot down. Others come out of holes in the ground beneath collapsing platforms, and certain monsters will, when shot, run away from Tokoro-san and run down all monsters in their path. Shooting the pistol will use up the water reserve, which will decrease the range of the shots. Leaving enemies alone when possible is therefor a good strategy. When Tokoro-san enters a house, a boss battle must be run through before he can choose a path to other districts in the town. When the player is hit too many times by monsters, or the water pistol runs out of water, the game is over.</desc>

Rosenkreuz strikes your grandfather, and kidnaps Miu! Before grandfather dies, he could only whisper: "Save... Miu...". And thus, Michimune embarks on a dangerous journey to the land of evil, to save Miu from the clutches of Rosenkreuz.

"Seirei Gari" is a horror-themed adventure game along the lines of the more known  Uninvited or  Deja Vu. Every action is performed by choosing a command from the menu. You should examine every location before objects become "visible" and possible to interact with. Sometimes you'll also have companions at your side who will help you on your quest.</desc>

		<name>Ghostbusters</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

		<desc>In Ghoul School the player is cast as Spike O'Hara, a senior at Cool School High in a small American town. Spike is a rebel and an outcast, but is a good kid. While taking a shortcut through the graveyard home one day, he comes across a glowing skull. Intrigued, he takes it to Dr. Femur, his anatomy teacher, the next day, which happens to be the day before Halloween. Dr. Femur wants to keep it for an overnight study, and Spike reluctantly agrees, noticing that the skull appeared bigger than the day before.

During the night, the skull begins transmitting a message to the realm of the dead. On Halloween, the dead begin their assault. The teachers and students inside are turned into zombies and demons under the control of whatever intelligence has taken over the school. Samantha Pom-Pom, the head cheerleader, is captured by the dead and held somewhere inside the school. Paranormal eliminators and members of the football team have ventured inside to find her, but have not returned. When Spike learns of the mess from the TV news, he rushes to the school and decides to rescue her himself.

Spike ventures inside. The doors shut and lock behind him. There's no turning back now.

Spike begins his quest with only his trusty baseball bat and battered sneakers, but can collect better weapons and shoes along the way. Among them are the straightforward sickle, embalming fluid, towel and almighty gamma gun, the strange Deweytron and taserlike Spinal Zap, and a sandwich (if it can be used as a weapon, they should have fired the cafeteria workers a LONG time ago), among other weapons. Useful items include the spring shoes, needed to reach high places, the suction shoes, which allow you to walk on the ceiling, and the Golden Apple, needed to bypass the Medusa head guarding the way to the second half of the school.

Get going! You have 129 rooms to explore and Samantha is counting on you. Good luck.</desc>

The game Mr. Gimmick is a platform game where you take control of Mr. Gimmick over the course of six levels. You defend yourself by throwing bouncing stars that take a second to form and are then thrown downward. You can also ride the stars thrown to gain access to higher platforms. The inventory you have allows you to store bombs, potions, and fireballs.

The game has two endings. The easier way is to just run through all of the levels. Each level has a treasure hidden that can be a bit difficult to get, and finding all of these gives access to an extra level. But if you lose all of your lives and have to continue, the game will take all of your treasures away, and not allow you to get to the final level.</desc>

The goal of the game is to direct the various commanders of the player character's fleet by giving them specific orders. Eventually, the player will be required to direct massive battles between their fleet and the rival empire's. A NES midi variant of the classical music piece Bolero by Ravel plays throughout, lending the game a suitably operatic feel.</desc>

However, an alien species from the far reaches of outer space began attacking the human forces, putting the very survival of the human race at stake. Though it was only a matter of time before Earth fell to the enormous power of the enemy forces, the Earth's army commander issued an order calling all of the units dispersed around the colonized planets to return to Earth. The player takes the role of a young soldier who was stationed with the Rayieza unit on the planet Mars.

		<desc>In this second installment of "Greek mythology" RPG series, the main hero is not the legendary hero Herakles (Hercules), but a young boy from a town Nana, where he lives with his grandmother. The queen tells you that people are being tortured by Titans - an ancient god-like race controlled by the Lord of darkness. You must help to liberate people from the wrath of the Titans. Your first assignment is to go to Athens and to find the famous poet Homer who can tell you about the way to defeat the Titans. During your journey you meet many characters from the Greek mythology, including Daedalus, Cerberus, and Hephaestus, and recruit interesting creatures to fight at your side, such as the half-horse Centaur or the Woman Without Soul. You'll also encounter real people from the Greek history, like Homer the poet or Hippocrates the doctor.

The gameplay is similar to  Dragon Warrior style: you travel on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, talking to people, and fighting random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. An interesting innovation is a full day/night cycle. Locations look different at night, and it is sometimes necessary to visit them at different times.

There is no world map in the game, but a continuous location complete with towns and dungeon-like areas.

		<name>Igo - Kyuu Roban Taikyoku</name>
		<desc>Igo: Kyuu Roban Taikyoku is the first real attempt to bring the Japanese board game Go to a home console, namely the Famicom. The game was designed by Henk Rogers, a Dutch programmer who would play games of Go against the CEO (at the time) of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi. It was during one such game that the prospect of developing such a title for the Famicom was discussed. It was later converted from disk format to cartridge and release in August 1987. 

Prior to the release of this game, Nintendo had released a game which was played on the Go board in 1983, known as Gomoku Narabe Renju, but the play mechanics were more akin to "Connect Four" (or five, as it were). The real game of Go is traditionally played on a 19 Ã— 19 grid, but the permutations of possibilities would take too long for the Famicom's processor to consider, so the board size has been significantly reduced to a 9 Ã— 9 grid, which allows for a smoother single player experience. The game also features a lesson mode, in which ninjas appear to teach the player about the rules and strategy of the game.</desc>

The game keeps the straightforward side-scrolling beat 'em up formula and even removes some of the maze-like elements in the previous game, adding new weapons and upgrades to make the game more action-oriented. Wandering through the stages is still possible and you can enter several stores and locations and trigger amusing humorous sequences keeping in tone with the lighthearted spirit of the series.</desc>

There are three difficulty levels and the game is almost completely in Japanese. There are also three modes: leaderboard (similar to major PGA events), tournament (using a format found in most sports playoffs), and stroke play. Players have a crowd to play their round of golf into front of.
In the hardest difficulty levels, players are confronted with wind levels approaching that of a hurricane while the wind is almost stagnant in the easiest difficulty level.[3] One of the drawbacks of the game is that the player must determine the angle of their flight separately from the strength of their swing and the type of golf club that they will use.</desc>

You can practice setting up putts, dealing with wind resistance, choosing a strike point on the golf ball, and other technical aspects of golfing in the two training modes the game offers. Once you feel you have enough experience you can enter the Golf Grand Slam, a tournament against 29 other fictitious pro players.

The game features 4 sets of 14 different golf clubs that you can bring to the course. The golfing is done by lining up a cursor to where you want the ball to land and then choosing the proper golf club, stance, and grip. The last step before taking the swing is finding the correct contact point on the golf ball. The contact point is represented as a dot that scatters around on top of a golf ball icon and you have to try to stop it on the part of the ball where you want your club to make contact with the ball.</desc>

Unfortunately, the treasure is buried under the hide-out of the infamous Fratelli gang, a family of ruthless criminals who are on the run from the law. You play as the asthmatic Mikey, who must find the treasure and save the other Goonies before time runs out.

The game consists of six levels. In each level, you must collect three keys to advance to the next area. These can be found by blowing open doors with bombs that are dropped by enemies. Also hidden behind doors are power-ups and other Goonies to rescue. Trying to stop you are enemies such as rats, skeletons, and even members of the Fratelli Gang. 

Unlike the sequel, the Famicom version was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

		<name>The Goonies II</name>
		<desc>In a movie released in the 1980s, a group of youngsters formed a special gang and called themselves The Goonies.  Nintendo banked upon the movie’s popularity by releasing several games using the characters and music from it, including the theme song by Cyndi Lauper.  This is their second game on NES, The Goonies being released only for the Famicom system outside the United States.

You play Mikie, one of the gang members, whose friends have been kidnapped by the gang’s arch enemy – the Fratelli family.  Your buddies and Annie the Mermaid must be rescued, but it won’t be easy sneaking into the dark and creepy underground hideout where they are being held.  You must find a way to destroy their master computer and keep your friends from becoming road kill.  If Ma Fratelli or crazy Cousin Pipsqueak doesn’t stop you, one of her two crazy sons will!

Upon starting the game, Mikie is armed only with a yo-yo and the ability to jump.  As the game progresses, he will find boomerangs, a gun, bombs, molotave cocktails and even scuba gear to help him. Fight snakes, spiders, skeletons, man-eating fish while exploring the huge world full of cellars, secret caverns and elaborate mazes.

There is more than typical side-scrolling action, although there’s certainly a multitude of that.  Seventeen magic implements and many secret messages await you.  When Mikie enters a room he can talk to NPCs and try to find hidden items and doors by hitting the walls.  A password lets you keep your possessions for the next game.</desc>

		<name>Gotcha! : The Sport!</name>
		<desc>Gotcha! is an NES Zapper title based on the "sport" of paintball, and loosely tied into the paintball-themed movie caper of the same name. You are required to traverse three different battle zones, grab the opposing teams' flag from the opposite end of the field, and make it back to your flag without getting shot.

One hand controls the Zapper while the other must hold the controller, since the D-Pad controls your movement up and down the field. Limited ammo is also a concern, as is the ability for the computer team to snag your flag and return it to their base to win. You can chase down and tag the flag carrier yourself to prevent this.

The game contains three difficulty levels and three different zones (woods, city, snowfield) which cycle until you lose all of your lives. Numbers of enemies and their reaction time increase with each cycle. Aside from additional ammo, there are no powerups, no teammates, just you against the computer for a beat-your-highest-score challenge.</desc>

		<desc>Oishinbo puts us in the role of Yamaoka Shiro as he helps brainstorm for Tozai News' upcoming VIP banquet. He meets with a trio of gourmands visiting his publication, one of whom extols the culinary merits of foie gras. Shiro is dismissive due to its ugly appearance (never mind the animal cruelty), causing a heated argument between the two. Filled with rage, Shiro heads back to his desk to try and come up with a dish that will blow foie gras out of the water.

It is here that the game begins in earnest, and the most familiar hallmark of the ADV genre begins to rear its head: busywork. The player needs to look at and interact with everything they possibly can if they want to make any progress, often multiple times. The lengths of which the game goes to to pad itself out is often ridiculous, such as when Shiro is only able to visit his own workplace cafeteria after reading a sign that informs him that it exists.</desc>

		<desc>Grand Master is an action RPG, featuring a cool intro, neat music, and most importantly: a hero with a sword so high you can't get over it, so low you can't get under it, and so wide you can't get around it.
The game itself plays from a top-down perspective, a bit like The Legend of Zelda, but with some extra RPG elements added in. It features a basic leveling system that maxes out at 10 and basic HP and MP stats that increase by 10 each level up until they reach 99. The stages are also in the same vein as The Legend of Zelda in regards to the dungeons, albeit in a much simpler form. Instead of an overworld, you instead pick from five stages on a world map and each stage follows the same basic formula that consists of finding the key to open the door to the boss. Each stage contains various enemies that respawn, the occasional warp point, and a handful of chests that contain a new weapon, accessory and healing items. The final stage also follows the same pattern, but it's about five stages combined into one and borders on torture/redundancy with a series of mazes and long passageways that take forever to pass. It is at odds with the first five stages.
The game makes use of a branching path system that's based on the order in which you clear all the stages. If certain events are not triggered, you will get a bad ending. The optimal order is as follows:Castle, Ice Temple, Cave, Pyramid, Tower. If you enter the Tower before the Cave level, you will
get the bad ending.If you enter the Pyramid before the Cave level, you will get an alternate story branch.</desc>

To save it from becoming another generic action game, innovation is shown through fast paced gameplay and the "gravity flip" ability, which enables the character to freely switch between moving along the floor or ceiling. While the game is only seven levels long, the difficulty ramps up quickly, so mastery of the gravity technique and memorization of the levels become absolute necessities for survival.</desc>

At the end of the round, you get a bonus if all cards are cleared, and you lose points for each card not cleared. You also get a bonus for stoppage time remaining. Pushing one button shuffles you between four cards, and pushing the other lets you eat up any part of the two minutes' grace period the game awards you per level. You can use it to make sure you drop something in the right place, or to get an idea of what to move next. It's an innovative concept among early Tetris games, trading time for points, and given the potential complexity of the game, it offers a fair amount of relief without spoon feeding the player. Great deal gives you points for 3 suits in a row, or any straight, or 3 of a kind in a row or on a diagonal. You get big points for 4 
or 5.</desc>

The player controls a magnifying glass and must click on various items for different effects. Finding a clock adds more time to the search, clicking on a 150 icon adds 150 points to the score, etc.

Each picture consists of 6 adjacent screens containing a continuous theme. The themes are The Carpet Flyers, The Underground Hunters, The Battling Monks, The Unfriendly Giants and The Land of Waldos. Players are given the option of playing on Normal difficulty, Expert difficulty, or playing the Land of Waldos stage. The only difference between the difficulties is that on expert there are no clock items to provide players with extra time.

In all of the stages the player must find both Waldo and a scroll to complete the stage. Waldo must be found before the scroll in order to complete the stage. Waldo's dog Woof is also in each of these stages (except for the Land of Waldos) and by finding him players get to play a small bonus stage where they collect points as they control the dog on a flying carpet.</desc>

On the NES you can tap the A button to fire up and right, the B button to fire up and left, or A and B simultaneously to fire straight ahead. One-button control systems mimic all this.</desc>

		<desc>In the peaceful town of Carpentersville, some workers known as The Rusty Nailers decide to bulldoze a house that belongs to Harry. Harry is certainly not happy with this, and goes on a rampage, destroying workers that get in his way. As Harry, you can destroy workers in one of two ways: you can smash them when one of them gets near them, or you can pound the ground, and by doing this, you will send shockwaves in both directions. 

There are four environments in which Harry needs to get through: construction sites, sewer, ship, and the mansion where Harry meets the leader who ordered the demolition of his house. At the end of each environment, a boss needs to be defeated in order to proceed to the next environment. In between these, there are bonus stages in which you have to destroy a number of enemies before time runs out.</desc>

The setting is a hat factory, where hats are dropped down from a conveyor belt two at a time and must be stacked on one of six mannequin heads. Once five hats of the same kind have been stacked on top of each other, they fall down onto another conveyor belt below and are shipped out of the factory, rewarding the player with a cash bonus. (The game keeps track of score as money, not simply points.)  Once you ship out enough hats out of the shop, you go up a level to the next shop. The higher shop number you get to, the more types of hats start appearing to make it more difficult for you to accomplish your task. The game ends when one of your stacks of hats reaches the top of the screen.</desc>

In Downhill the object is to get down the slope as fast as possible. In Slalom you have to guide the board between the gates. In halfpipe, you have to perform stunts on a half pipe. In Moguls, you have to jump over both small and large moguls. In Backwoods, you'll be given different obstacles to contend with and you'll have to find away to get around them.

You also earn points by executing various stunts along the way. Stunts you can pull off are a toe grab, hand-plant, mid-air 360, and a mule-kick.

There are three different peaks, each featuring a couple different runs. The mountain ranges consist of Poseur Peak, Scary Summit, and Mt. Mortified.</desc>

		<name>Hello Kitty World</name>
		<desc>The little kitten Kitty, her kitten friend Mimi and their bear friend Tippy love playing with balloons. One day, Tippy has inflated a whole bunch of balloons when suddenly a strong wind blows. Tippy is blown away! The only way for Kitty and Mimi to find their friend again is to pick some balloons and fly to her rescue.

Hello Kitty World is quite similar to Balloon Kid – a forced side-scrolling platform adventure where you control a character floating around with a balloon in the hand. Kitty (or Mimi) starts out on each level with two balloons, and by pushing the A button, she moves upward before sinking again if the button is not pushed again. When Kitty comes in contact with an enemy, she will just rebound, but she will fall to the ground if both balloons are hit. By pushing the B button, Kitty can also choose to let go in order to walk around like a normal platform character. This is necessary in order to reach power-ups and hidden areas. Since the scrolling is forced, it is easy to go get stuck and pushed off the screen.

Throughout the levels, Tippy has dropped balloons that can be picked up for points. If twenty balloons are picked up in succession, they turn into double balloons worth more points. Enemies come both in the airbourne and ground-based varieties, along with some fish that can surprisingly jump out of the water. Some enemies can only fly by holding balloons, and just like in Balloon Fight, these can be disposed of by touching their balloons.</desc>

She can defend herself with the use of a large mallet. Running into enemies will make her cry, which causes Kitty to get angry and lose a life. Points in the game are collected as money for the cash register. Allowing the time limit to expire will also cause the player to lose a life. However, there are infinite continues and losing the game score is the only penalty for "game overs." There are 18 stages in the game and the game does not repeat itself after the 18th stage. While the second half of the game is more difficult then the first nine levels, they can be cleared once the player is accustomed to the game controls.</desc>

Ponkikki was a long-running Japanese children's program similar to Sesame Street; this game features the show's two main characters, Gachapin the dinosaur and Mukku the yeti, in a little friendly competition. Five mini-games repeat over the course of five islands, and each island must be cleared of all five games before proceeding to the next. The set-up is mainly intended for two players, with one player controlling Gachapin and the other Mukku. In one-player mode, either character may be selected, but the CPU will not compete at any game other than rock-paper-scissors. Players begin with a limited number of lives which may be lost by colliding with enemies or performing poorly at minigames; one extra life is also awarded at the end of each island. However, there is also a password system which allows the game to be resumed from any island.</desc>

Starting from your village, you must explore your surroundings by walking and jumping across the land in simple side-scrolling fashion, that is until you run across an enemy (fellow martial artists, bandits, ghouls, etc.) and enter combat mode, which allows you to unleash attacks based on your skill level to try and defeat your opponent (always using the 2D side-scrolling engine).

Victory will earn you money and other bonuses which can be used back in town to upgrade your skills and regain health. You can also enter special tournaments found as special buildings across the land in which you must defeat a series of opponents in succession before facing off against the reigning champion. Victory here will reward you with even more money and will mean more people will recognize you in your travels.</desc>

		<name>Hissatsu Shigoto Nin</name>
		<desc>Hissatsu Shigotonin roughly translates to Deadly Work People. I found this name to be pretty strange, but once I started understanding what this game was all about, it made sense. It was released December 15, 1990 exclusively in Japan for the Famicom. It turns out Hissatsu Shigotonin is actually biased off of the popular Japanese historical drama TV series of the same name. The story of both focus on a group of ordinary "work people" who live double lives as assassins. It is an alternate Feudal Japan history (1603-1863) featuring fictional characters with elements of a parallel world. You must uncover a mystery though out the game, which comes though the story in episodes like the TV show. The player controls Nakamura Mondo, a fictional character who is also the star of the TV show. The game is biased on the original 84 episode run/first season of the TV series from 1979-1981 but features characters all the way up to the gameâ€™s release date. The show continues to this day with Assassins as a subtitle. This seems like a really cool concept for a weekly episodic series. The story has an almost assassins creed feel. Iâ€™m sure the idea of everyday people turned into warriors has been around in stories forever, but the setting and time period makes it stand out. Japanâ€™s feudal era is one of the most intense of all the time periods in earthâ€™s history. It was a time of Samurai, Ninja and technology that eventually killed off said Samurai and Ninja. One of the biggest draws of the era is the is the fantastic culture that knew of the outside world, but worked hard in maintaining isolation making them truly unique. The main character, Nakamura Mondo, is a corrupt cop known for accepting bribes who is disrespected by his superiors, and mother-in-law. He ends up bringing together a group of people that have all been wronged in some way, formed to solve mysteries and assassinate targets. The heroes play by the same rules as the villains, as they are not afraid to use underhanded tactics to get the job done. Each episode of the show usually climaxes with the killing of the target, sometimes in an almost humorous manner such as a flower through the skull. I was able to find a random episode but no dubs or subs, which is a bummer since I wanted to learn more of the story. It seems to hold up well to time, has a campy feel to it and comes off like a live action anime. Check out this trailer for one of their many movies to get a better idea of the style, think Al Bundy the Samuri and his gang of misfits.</desc>

Holy Diver is an action game much in the vein of Castlevania.

Enemies throughout the levels respawn and there are destroyable objects in your path. At the end of each level a tougher boss character must be beaten. Once defeated a power-up spell becomes available to the player. To use these spells the player must pause the game and select it from the inventory menu. The player has the ability to shoot horizontally as well as up. Difficult paths may sometimes be crossed by the combination of the right spell at the right time such as the freezing spell that freezes quicksand. 

Though scheduled for release in North America, the game never went beyond its release in Japan.</desc>

The legends of the Playground are all here: Mr. Doc, Jammer, Legs, Bomber, Wiz, eight players in all. You can pit them one-on-one or two-on-two. You pick the court - Eastern or Western - and you pick the rules, too. You can play against the computer or one other player. Or you can even team up with another player against the computer. You can block shots, make steals, pass off or go strong to the hoop - in fact, you control just about everything in this ultra-realistic rendition of the playground game. Except, of course, the final score. But win or lose, you know you've been in a game after you've played a game of HOOPS!</desc>

		<desc>Players get to dig up dirt beneath the surface, find keys behind four doors, and then find the door to the next level. The most obvious game to compare it to is Dig Dug, but without the boulders and with various devices like teleporting doors, speed, dynamite, and a wet suit. There are 15 levels in the entire game; which repeat themselves after the 15th level is finished. Lava can spew out at a vertical direction towards the player and kill him; it does not reset itself even after the players loses a life (but it does reset itself after a game over) Passwords are activated by pressing a certain button combination on the password screen. Several passwords results in cheat codes that does certain things; such as deactivating the lava in all levels of the game. Certain type of blocks are worth different points once they are dug up; ranging from common dirt to destructible blocks. The game features an instant death clause where players die in a single hit. Killed enemies reappear at the same location where they were killed the first time.</desc>

In the anime, Takahashi and Honey get into various adventures along with three ordinary school children from Earth. 
While the game draws inspiration from the anime (which itself drew inspiration from Adventure Island) the game does not necessarily follow any of the episodes of the show. Instead, the game consists of four stages. In the first stage, you control Bug-tte Honey, who has the ability to fly about the screen. At the end of the first stage, Honey rescues Takahashi by smashing the cage he is being held captive in. From that point forward, the player controls Takahashi (Called Master Higgins in the US/EU version)</desc>

While on its trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has hijacked the submarine along with it's crew. They plan to defect to the United States. Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. 

You control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed. Power-Ups to increase or decrease the power of missiles and torpedoes may be found by destroying enemies.</desc>

Equipped with your magical sword, you must roam the land of Hydlide and defeat the evil once again.

This is the second NES game of Hydlide series ("Hydlide 2" was only available for the MSX platform). You can choose one of the four character classes to start the game with, and also upgrade your class during the game. The combat is action-based: you can either attack your enemies by ramming them with your weapons, or cast magical spells. In towns there are equipment and items to buy.

The full sequence of events is - swimming, skeet shooting, gymnastics, archery, triple jumping and weightlifting. You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one.

Swimming involves moving left and right as fast as possible, while pressing fire when a breath is required. Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing - though elevation and wind factors affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.

If the player wants to go to the next event or round, they will have to qualify by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum targets.</desc>

		<desc>Games end after seven innings unless the two teams have an identical score (tie game). The object is to win the championship using female softball players. Players must choose between the six major high schools from all of the regions of Japan. The artificial intelligence of the game is strong, causing even strong human-controlled teams to frequently lose to the computer. It is possible to throw an underhanded pitch in this game up to 120 kilometres per hour (75 mph).

After winning the Japanese high school championship, the player must take on the American women's softball team before becoming a professional softball player.The game looks similar to a video game that belongs to the Family Stadium baseball video game franchise. Players play their high school games at Hanshin KÅshien Stadium.

If the player loses one game, play starts over unless the player uses a password to return to the previous round. The game's password feature allows games to be replayed and maintains total memory of which teams have already been defeated. However, the passwords and long and very difficult to remember.

Pachio-kun, an anime-like pachinko ball that is famous for starring in the game American Dream (which was made by the same company as I Love Softball), announces the team that will be batting for three outs.</desc>

Gameplay consists of very standard jump and shoot platform action.  As you progress through the 8 levels, you gain the ability to perform spells, such as turning into a bat, and different special attacks, such as a spread / homing attack. You can also spend the coins you get when you defeat enemies in one of several mini-games that show up when you're between levels.

The player has many choices of styles of the backing track, from popular styles such as Rock, Techno, and Jazz, to various ethnic flavors such as Bossa, Rio, Japan, India, Arabia, etc.

The backing tracks representing the styles use familiar elements to make the game more accessible to the general audience. For example, in the Scotland style Cadence to Arms, a familiar bagpipes tune, is used.

Most backing tracks loop around one or two chords, allowing an open improvisation on the main keyboard. Once the style is chosen, the main keyboard is masked in the way that only the scale that easily fits into the style is available, e.g. blues scale, pentatonic scale, etc.

The keyboard is controlled by the UP-DOWN or LEFT-RIGHT d-pads on the game controller so there is no way to play leaps in the scale.

Due to the hardware limitation, the sound produced is the typical 8-bit chiptune music.</desc>

		<desc>A mysterious alien life form is spreading across the galaxy, trying to conquer the world. It took control of the moon base and is threatening to descend on the Earth. The humans have sent the most advanced fighter jet to oppose the aliens: the OF-1. The OF-1  has the ability to change speed at any time and equip different weapons and pods. OF-1 is humanity's last hope!

Image Fight is a top-down vertically scrolling space shooter. On every level there will be enemy ships, turrets, robots, and other machines shooting projectiles or trying to ram you. But there are also power-ups scattered around in small green containers. You must destroy these containers before you can obtain the power-up. Those power-ups include pods that add extra attack power or speed, new kinds of weapons, the ability to fire in different directions, etc.</desc>

		<name>The Immortal</name>
		<desc>The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.

Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of 
isometric death await.

The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.

The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.</desc>

		<desc>Junkman breaks into the crash test center and kidnaps two of the Incredible Crash Dummies, Daryl and Spare Tire with the intentions of using them for their parts to build his junkbots. Now it's up to Slick and Spin to go and rescue the kidnapped crash dummies.

In The Incredible Crash Dummies the player alternates between Slick and Spin as they go through five levels with each level containing 2 stages (except for the 4th level which only consists of one). One of the Dummies' legs has been replaced with a wheel while the other Dummy has his legs intact. So the main difference in gameplay is that in some stages the player either rolls throughout it or walks throughout it. The Dummies' arsenal includes an air gun which stuns enemies at close range and an oil gun which shoots and kills enemies at a far range. There are also a few powerups scattered throughout the stages such as the arrow, balloon, and arm powerup.</desc>

		<name>Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade</name>
		<desc>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade differs from the two other games with the same name as it is a hybrid of various genres such as platform action, motorcycle racing, puzzle solving and even some adventure elements.

In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade you play Indy's role in his search for the Holy Grail, but this time it is you who chooses which step he will take at each part of his quest. For example, in the very beginning you receive a diary about the Grail from Indy's father, who is in Venice. At the same time, you receive a telegram from Marcus saying that the Cross of Coronado is in Portugal on a ship called Coronado, and that he'll meet Indy there. So you have to choose what you'll do first: go to Venice and check about the Grail and your father, or go to Portugal to find Marcus and the Cross of Coronado.

In the entire game you'll be prompted with these choices, each one leading to different stages throughout the game. Each stage presents different game genres. For example, in Venice you find a scrambled picture of the Grail, and you have to try to put it back together, just like you'd do with the pieces of a puzzle. Besides, in the platform stages, Indy has plenty of movements, as he can punch, kick, walk, run, jump and use his whip.

The game presents bitmapped pictures of the real movie actors, such as Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.</desc>

As Indy you must complete several cycles of the following 3 types of levels:Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children that are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children.
2. Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks &amp; guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track.
3. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava.
With every cycle the mine &amp; mine cart levels become more complex, the layout of the temple levels is always the same. After several cycles there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope bridge.</desc>

Heavy Forces are too slow and visible to be of any use, but perhaps something smaller and lighter may make it in where larger forces would fail. A small jeep, maybe two, crewed by about 4 people.... minimal enough not to represent too much of a loss and yet suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course, if these brave men want to succeed AND come back alive; they'll need to fight like animals... they'll need to fight like jackals...

Jackal is an overhead view jeep game for up to 2 players. The controller moves in four directions, button A fires your gernades (upgradable to bazooka) and button B your machine gun which ALWAYS fires to the top of the screen. Your mission is to locate facilities where soldiers are being held prisoner, rescue as many as possible, and escort them to a safe landing zone where they will be air transported away. After that, you'll need to fight a boss battle against the enemy to progress.</desc>

Extra conch shells can be earned in bonus rounds where a sea plane flies over the water to bomb jellyfish (think the bonus rounds of Galaga with reversed perspective).

The diver will battle Jaws several times in an attempt to wear down his life meter.  If the player is lucky, they can find a submarine to increase their firepower and defense.

If the diver manages to wear down Jaws' energy, they take back to the boat again, launching strobes into the water in an attempt to lure the shark out of the water.  If close enough, the player can use the boat to ram Jaws in an attempt to kill him and win the game.</desc>

In this spin-off adventure, George Jetson is tasked my his employer to put a stop to the profit-making schemes of the rival Cogswell's company. To do this, George must hop from location to location in his jet and conquer each level using the resources available to him, as well as with the assistance of the other Jetson franchise characters.

Cogswell's Caper is a side-scrolling action game where George Jetson can walk, crouch, and jump (actually, he's too lazy to jump and a jet pack handles the jumping duty for short bursts). Each level is littered with crates and other items that George can pick up and toss at enemies, while finding useful items (and occasionally even more enemies) underneath them. Since the game is set in the futuristic world of the Jetsons, there are also copious switches on walls which activate all kinds of features of the surroundings, such as a switch that reverses gravity for a brief time.

Select your team's home city (there is no NFL or NFLPA license, so there are no real teams or players) and then battle the opposing team for four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.  Graphics are simple: one team has blue uniforms, the other team red ones.  The human player gets control of the quarterback on offense and the middle linebacker on defense.  The play perspective is top-down and vertical-scrolling.  Choose from 9 offensive--mostly passing--plays and 6 defensive plays.  Teams have 9 players each.</desc>

		<name>Jordan vs Bird : One On One</name>
		<desc>Two of the greatest icons of the Golden Age of the NBA match up in this game. On one side, the spectacular dunks of Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls; on the other, Larry Bird's incredible accuracy from the outside. 

While Bird feels right home at the three-point contest, where five racks with five balls each are placed around the three-point arc and the player must pick each ball and throw in the the best timing possible to get as many points as possible during the 60 second window, only Jordan has the air-time to perform on the slam dunk contest, where the player has a number of dunks at his disposal, each requiring different timing to get the best score from all three attempts from the judges, and win the competition.

While they are two completely different players, they can still go one-on-one on a half-court match, played to points or with a time duration. Can Bird's stealing and outside shooting ability be a match to Jordan's speed and jumping abilities?

Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded "unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl.

The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</desc>

Fortunately his former partner, Dr. Eamon, saved one robot from the takeover and has now programmed him to defeat the other robots and foil Dr. Warunachi's evil plans.

Joy Mecha Fight is a one-on-one 2D fighter, in which you control a robot and attempt to defeat your opponent by attacking him with your basic moves and special attacks triggered by specific control motions. Each robot is composed of six hovering segments: the head, torso and limbs, which hover around each other forming a basic humanoid shape. 

The game features story, instant fight, and Vs modes. In the story mode you start with the Sukapon robot, and as you defeat other robots they become available for selection as you advance through the story with all moves being explained via a pre-fight tutorial if you want to.

		<desc>One of many different titles based on Steven Spielberg's 1993 dinosaur thriller, the version for NES and Game Boy is a top-down action game with exploration elements.

Playing as Dr. Alan Grant, the player must work through six levels by completing certain objectives including rescuing the kids Tim and Lex, restoring power, destroying Raptor nests and finally getting off the dinosaur-infested island. To advance in a level, a number of dinosaur eggs scattered over the area must be collected or destroyed. This will reveal a passcard used to gain entry to buildings, or some other items necessary to complete the assignment. The park's computer terminals can be used to request hints on where to go next.

Naturally, the levels are full of hostile dinosaurs. Dr. Grant can fend them off with his gun. Several ammunition types are available, varying in damage and shooting patterns. Killed dinosaurs will always drop the most basic ammo type, the others must be found. Next to ammo clips, there are boxes with question marks on them to be collected. These might include beneficial powerups like a health increase, but can also be dangerous and reveal a bomb.

Some levels end in boss encounters, including a Triceratops stampede and a fight against the Tyrannosaurus Rex.</desc>

It is based on Bandai's Kamen Rider franchise, a weekly science fiction story created by Japanese manga artist Shotaro Ishinomori which was published in Sh?nen Magazine, as well as being aired on television. The story takes place in a world plagued by Shocker, a mysterious terrorist organization. To further its plans for world domination, Shocker recruited its agents through kidnapping, turning their victims into mutant cyborgs and, ultimately, brainwashing them. However, one victim named Takeshi Hongo escaped just before the final brainwashing. With his sanity and moral conscience intact, Hongo battled Shocker's minions as the grasshopper-themed altered human superhero Kamen Rider. Another of Shocker's victims, freelance photographer Hayato Ichimonji, had also been given cyborg implants, but was saved by Kamen Rider from the brainwashing process to become Kamen Rider #2. Assisted by motorcycle race team manager Tobei Tachibana and FBI agent Kazuya Taki, the Kamen Riders fought in both solo and partnered missions against both Shocker and its successor organization Gel-Shocker.</desc>

To further explain, the main character's name is Kantarou, and he throws bombs at his enemies. He is attempting to travel from Kyoto back to Edo (known today as Tokyo) to see his girlfriend Momoko. To get there, he is traveling through the Tokaido highway which is composed of 53 checkpoints along the way. However, an unscrupulous merchant is attempting to capture Kantarou and steal his explosive technique secrets.

Tokaido Gojuusan Tsugi is a horizontally scrolling action game developed by Sunsoft in 1986. It was never released outside of Japan. On June 29, 2001, the game was released for the Windows platform as part of Sunsoft Classic Games 2 along with Ikki (which was itself rereleased as a budget title in 2004). On December 27, 2001, the game was released on the PlayStation as part of Memorial Series: Sunsoft Vol. 3 along with The Wing of Madoola.</desc>

		<name>Kart Fighter</name>
		<desc>This game can be purely considered the 'illegal' predecessor of Super Smash Bros., since it's, ironically, Street Fighter II with Mario Kart characters. All in all, it copies the mechanics of Street Fighter II in almost everything, starting from the moves and ending with combo system.

Like in Mario Kart, there is an overall of eight characters to choose from, starting with Mario, going through Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Koopa, Yoshi, Donkey Kong Jr. and, finally, Bowser, whom you have to defeat two times during the arcade play. Most of the character roster is being a huge bunch of shotoclones, with one of the few exceptions being Peach, who has Chun-Li's moveset, Koopa, who has some sort of a 'kamikaze' projectile and Donkey Kong who throws a ground projectile, similar to Terry's Power Wave.

The game has original sprites and music, although some graphics were obviously reused from such games as Little Nemo: The Dream Master and Wario Land 4, not to say about the use of the graphics from Mario games themselves.

Like in many games based on the same engine (along with NES Street Fighter II port by the same developers), this has the two-player mode, apart from the contrary belief, by pressing the A button on the second gamepad during player select sequence.</desc>

In fact, the box art states the former as developer and the title screen states the latter. As a true simulation game, there is no racing (at least that the player can control) or gambling. The player instead can fiddle with the parameters for each race and the horses competing, changing their stats such as fatigue, age and the weight of the jockey. Then players can watch a race with these settings play out and observe the winner. It is possible the goal of this game is to recreate the likely output of an actual race based on as much information as the player is able to muster in order to assist them with their gambling, though its more likely the game is for racing enthusiasts.</desc>

		<name>Kero Kero Keroppi No Daibouken</name>
		<desc>Kero Kero Keroppi no Daibouken (Keroppi's Big Adventure) is based on the popular Sanrio character Keroppi. It is a children's puzzle game where Keroppi must rescue his girlfriend Keroleen who is locked up in a castle. To do so, he must solve the action based puzzles in seven differently themed worlds with four different types of stages (the surface of the maze, flying a plane, a Reversi-like level, and through a field of lava). All the items in the game are pre-determined; there is a need to memorize the pattern for each playthrough so that a player may advance through the levels more quickly once they have achieved a degree of expertise in the game.</desc>

So... being the heroes that Keroppi &amp; Keroleen are, they set off, armed with water balloons to rescue Teruteru Chan.

		<desc>Far away in peaceful Angel Land lived a young angel warrior named Pit, who has been given the task of defeating the monstrous Medusa, who wishes to destroy Angel Land and all of the people, and she has started by kidnapping Palutena, the Princess of Angel Land.

Young Pit must rescue the Princess and restore peace to Angel Land. He will travel from the deep caverns of the Underworld to Medusa's palace in the sky on his journey, and deadly monsters will attack him every step of the way. But he has the power of the Gods on his side! A powerful bow and arrows, Water of Life, and Angel Feathers will assist Pit on his quest to destroy Medusa and save the princess!

Kid Icarus is a platform game where the player goes through several vertically outlaid levels, shooting enemies with his bow on the way and collecting hearts they leave behind. Pit's bow can shoot both forward and upwards. As Pit continues upwards, more and more of the level ends up beyond the bottom of the screen and if Pit falls down out of the screen, he dies. 

The levels contain doors which lead to chambers of various types - some chambers are filled with enemies, some are treasuries which allow Pit to obtain a power-up, some are stores where Pit can buy stuff, some will replenish his health, in some Pit will be able to take a test in hopes of getting a powerful weapon, and finally some chambers give Pit a chance of receiving a strength upgrade, therefore increasing the amount of damage his attacks deal. 

Pit earns experience as he defeats enemies, and he gains levels from this experience. The more levels Pit has, the more maximum health he has. 

Hearts taken from enemies are used in shops to buy various items and power-ups. Items include a protective shield which harms enemies, a more powerful bow, a mallet which allows you to smash the poor Palutena's warriors turned to stone who will later help you to fight a boss, a torch to see yourself in dark areas and others.</desc>

He asks Kid Klown to help him open a treasure vault, but Kid Klown, having been warned about the evil magician by his parents, refuses. Not willing to give up so easily, Night Mayor kidnaps Kid Klown's family and dares him to follow him into his world if he ever wants to see his family again.

Kid Klown in Night Mayor World is a side-scrolling platformer. Kid Klown has to complete several different stages inhabited by various enemies. His most helpful tools are his balloons that he can throw at his enemies, use as a trampoline or cling to in order to float through the air. 

There are various items to be picked up as well, including bonus lifes, health power-ups, strawberries, lightnings that make Kid Klown temporarily invincible and question marks that can have the same effect as any of the other items, but might also reverse the controls.

After every completed stage, a bonus game can be played in which Kid Klown may win items by throwing balloons at them. The number of balloons available depends on the number of strawberries collected in the previous stage.</desc>

		<desc>Kid Kool is a side-scrolling platformer.  The king is sick and Kool must gather the seven magical herbs to cure him within three days.

Unlike most platformers, momentum is very important in Kid Kool.  He takes several steps to get up to full speed when running and cannot stop on a dime.  There is no air control, so how far he is able to jump depends entirely on how fast he was going when he left the ground.

Kool faces a variety of enemies.  They can be defeated by jumping on their heads.  The first jump drives them into the ground and the second eliminates them.  They also can be beaten with a furry companion that Kool can pick up by running fast enough past the appropriate spots.  He can be thrown with the B button, then retrieved by standing near him.  He also affords some protection as if Kool is hit while holding him, he will only lose his companion, not a life.</desc>

		<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

The game is a side scroller in which the heroine can wield a variety of different offensive capabilities (all available from the start of the game), selectable via a subscreen in her quest to wipe out wave after wave of robot invaders throughout the four levels. You also have a limited range broomstick at your disposal for riding across chasms and such.</desc>

In order to get her back, Thomas, a Kung-Fu master who runs a restaurant must travel the city, eventually reaching Mr. X's castle and attempt to rescue her.

Spartan X 2 is an expanded version of the original Spartan X game (aka Kung-Fu). Similar to that game, Spartan X 2 is a side-scrolling fighting game. Controlling Thomas, the player is able to move left and right, jump, kick and punch. Thomas has an energy bar and is defeated if he loses all of the energy. Some enemies drop items such as potions which will help replenish this bar. At the end of each level, Thomas encounters a boss.

Story cutscenes are displayed between each level, where Thomas contacts other characters through use of a computer.</desc>

They discover that in their absence, Princess Min-min has been kidnapped and the 10 treasures of the kingdom stolen. Jacky and Lee must fight their way into eight different castles in order to defeat the monsters and rescue the princess.

Chinese Hero is a top-down action game for one or two players, both playing on the same screen. Each ninja has the ability to move in any of four directions: up, down, left and right, as well as punch directly in front of them and do a "Moon Sault Kick" (which can be powered up to a "Miracle Kick") whereby they jump and somersault directly in front. Both punches and the Moon Sault Kick can harm enemies. Defeating a certain number of enemies on each level will open the doorway into the next level. Occasionally extra passages (named "Quick Passage Zone") can be found to take shortcuts through areas with stronger enemies. At times, defeated enemies will leave power-ups behind which either player can collect in order to increase their abilities temporarily. While power-ups are diverse, here are examples of some of the effects: weakening specific enemies, invincibility, increased attack, extra lives and the ability to use projectile attacks.

		<desc>Labyrinth is a maze game similar to Gauntlet, but with a more definite goal and some adventure elements. It is based upon the Jim Henson film of the same name incorporates many scenes from the movie as areas with the maze.

The goal of the game is to collect twelve coins Sara can use to buy back her baby brother from his kidnapper, the goblin king, Jareth. There is one coin in each of the twelve mazes surrounding the central castle. At first only a few of the mazes are accessible; however, upon collecting a section of a broken key, of which there is also one per region, Sara is sent to a hub where a friendly goblin will open up a new area. Each section of the maze has its own gimmick, for instance the Hedge Maze rearranges itself as the player wanders through it, and the Fieries' Forest is filled with teleports. The areas are also connected via a large underground maze. Upon gaining all the sections of the key Sara can open the door to the castle and enter the final series of mazes, however, she cannot win if she has not collected all of the coins.

Throughout all this Sara is constant beset by enemies at which she must throw a neverending supply of stones to dissipate.  Her stones can be upgraded eventually and she can also gain the favor of her friends from the movie who will follow her around and try to help her shoot at her aggressors.

All of this must be done in no more than 13 minutes or the game must be restarted, and every time an enemy attacks Sara she loses a few more seconds.  However, there are several ways to gain more time, and part of winning the game is balancing actually solving the maze and spending time searching for minutes to do just that.</desc>

		<desc>In 22th century, mankind has left the Earth. A new space epoch began, called the Isis era. Human beings built an oasis in deep space, a space station called LaGrange Point. From there, they could send expeditions to remote planets and to explore the space. You control a young pilot named Jin. One day, when you descend into LaGrange from your space ship, you are attacked by mysterious robotic invaders. Your task is now to travel through space and to find out the cause of the assault. But you don't even suspect you'll soon be involved in a deep mystery that was destined long time ago...

"LaGrange Point" is one of the few old-school console-style RPGs to be set in a science fiction environment and to feature space flights. The combat system requires you to use special points (called BP) in order to perform simple attacks, cast spells, and use various techniques that will cost you your HP. You fight random monsters and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, like in Phantasy Star series.</desc>

It features and is named for Japanese TV personality La Salle Ishii and focuses on a beleagured manager (the protagonist, named by the player) and his three-member up-and-coming J-Pop band "Childs". In order to get the fame and funding necessary to make Childs a big hit, the player (as the manager) must "fight" various stressed out officials and convince them to give the band royalties, equip the band with the equipment they need to perform and fly across Japan setting up deals and procuring more money. Also, the party operates in battle as a single entity - each piece of equipment also applies to every band member simultaneously.
The game plays almost identically to Dragon Quest, but is made considerably stranger by its modern Japanese setting and unusual premise.</desc>

		<desc>Long ago, an evil dragon named Keela was imprisoned inside a magical dungeon. However time has passed and the magic that sealed the dragon away is weakening. The Drasle family decides that it's time to destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.

Legacy of the Wizard is an side-scrolling action platform game with role-playing elements.  The player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.

The object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-resoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.</desc>

To avenge their deaths, the last of the Fuuma brothers vowed to slay the Dragon Master, and take back the Hadoukens.

Getsufuma Den is an action game with slight RPG elements. You travel through the overworld on pre-determined paths, which branch most of the time, leading you to shops, places where you can encounter other characters, and dungeons. Once you descend into a dungeon, you navigate your character on a platform, jumping and fighting enemies with your sword or other weapons. There are also a few first-person dungeons later in the game. In the dungeons you can collect money and then use it to buy weapons and other accessories on the overworld.</desc>

In most levels the player just has to move to the right side of the screen to reach the exit of each level. All the while enemies will spawn and attack Valiant. Aside from humans the game also offers its share of mythical creatures that have to be defeated including dragons. The player must also jump over pit traps and water or face death. The player can be hit multiple time and can regenerate health by finding power-ups. To combat the enemies the player can use Valiant's crossbow which shoots in a straight line.

		<name>The Legend of Zelda</name>
		<desc>In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.

The Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.

The game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link begins his quest in the Overworld, which features forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into several screens. Link can explore the Overworld freely, though when he enters a screen, he will encounter several enemies. He can attack them with his sword. If link is at full health, he can toss his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee range. 

Link's health is represented by hearts; initially he can have a maximum of three hearts, but as he progresses in the game, he will find heart containers that increase his maximum health. The enemies are varied - some attack from up close, some shoot projectiles. When killed, they often leave behind an item - a heart to restore energy, rupees that function as money (and can be used to buy stuff in various shops in the Overworld), or bombs which can be picked up and set down to attack enemies or destroy some walls. When enemies are killed, they stay dead and will not re-appear once the screen is entered again. 

There are other items to find in the game; some function as weapons, while others are used to solve puzzles. 

To find the Triforce pieces, Link must explore dungeons. Once he finds an entrance to the dungeon and goes in, he must explore the rooms, fight enemies and collect keys until he finds the boss monster he must defeat. He will then be able to pick up a Triforce piece. Once he does so, however, all the monsters in the Overworld come back to life. 

If Link dies on his quest, he can continue it; he will go back to his start position in the Overworld, but with the items he managed to collect so far. When Link finishes his quest, the pl;ayer can choose to play the "2nd quest", which is essentially a harder version of the game. 

The Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.</desc>

		<name>Legendary Wings</name>
		<desc>Legendary Wings is an arcade shooter influenced by Greek mythology.  A heroic figure from ancient times thrust into a strange futuristic world, you must fight your way through six levels to defeat "The Devil" and save the day.

The primary gameplay mode is a top-down, vertical-scrolling shooter similar to Xevious and Capcom's own 1943.  Your main weapon is used to attack flying enemies, and your secondary missile weapon is used to attack fixed placement, land-based enemies.  Numerous powerups are available along the way, and these both improve your weapons and your resistance to damage (every "upgrade" is worth a free hit from enemies without dying).

Several secondary gameplay modes (Danger, Lucky, and Palace) are also triggered at key points in the vertical-scrolling mode.  All of the secondary modes are side-scrolling shooters.  The Danger stage requires you to face a gauntlet of enemies, while the Lucky stage is full of powerups, game continues, and other bonuses.  The Palace stage is triggered when you defeat a mini-boss; you must get past the palace defenses before you can face the end-of-stage boss.  And, oh yeah...don't get crushed by those walls!</desc>

There is an exhibition mode which is just a single game and a tournament mode where you pick your players and then the computer pits you against the others in random made teams; win and you advance on to the next game. 

Pitching is done by a behind the batter view. The pitchers can throw the ball with three different speeds; slow, medium, and fast. Also, the fielders are controlled manually.

You can also choose between an old classic style stadium or a new modern style one. Besides the actual look of the place the only real difference between the two is that it's easier to hit a homerun in the old style stadium.</desc>

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it.

		<desc>Ninja Hattori-kun (lit. "Little Ninja Hattori") is a 1986 video game software developed and published by Hudson Soft for the Nintendo Family Computer exclusively in Japan. It is based on Fujiko Fujio A's (the pen name of Motoo Abiko) Japanese manga series of the same name, which later became an anime series and Asian franchise. The game was released around the same time the anime was aired. It was the fifth best selling Famicom game released in 1986, selling approximately 1,500,000 copies in its lifetime.
The plot begins when a young ninja name Kanzo Hattori was in search of his master in order to complete his training. While searching for his master, he encountered a young 10-year-old boy name Ken (Ken'ichi) Mitsobahis and made him his temporary replacement master, in order to develop Ken's confidence, while they went on many adventures together. It was aimed at a young audience the same way as the manga and anime it is based on.
In the game, player controls Kanzo Hattori in a side-scrolling action game. Hattori must run to the right over various terrains, but primarily through the woods. In addition to using throwing stars, Hattori can access one of the other ninja techniques, like Kagebashin, Happou no Shuriken, etc. In fact, he learns a total of 11 ninpou; however, he must first collect scrolls that provide those abilities before he can use them. Due to sluggish controls, it can be difficult to clear some of the obstacles that he will face without the ninja abilities to enhance his mobility.</desc>

		<name>Little Samson</name>
		<desc>Ta-Keed, the Prince of Darkness, has managed to escape from his supernatural penitentiary where he has had centuries to plot exactly how he will take revenge on those that locked him away. Emperor Hans sends his troops to deal with this threat, but they are no match for the ultimate evil one. As an alternative, the emperor summons the bearers of 4 Magical Bells. These 4 adventurers must make their way to the castle and work as a team if they are to destroy Ta-Keed.

The first part of Little Samson has each of the 4 characters journeying from his or her home land to the emperor's palace. This gives the player an opportunity to explore that character's unique abilities which will be essential throughout the game.

1. Samson is a human who is reasonably fast and also possesses magnificent rock climbing prowess. He is able to scale walls and hang across ceilings, and also grab onto walls and ceilings while jumping. His offensive option is the ability to shoot bells straight ahead.

2. Kikira is the Dragon Lord. Since she has claws, she does not slip on ice. When she jumps, she can also fly for short bursts. She breathes fire in 2 intensities, depending on how long the player holds down the fire button. Her fireballs spread in arc patterns.

3. Gamm is the Rock Lord. Since he is a living rock he is very strong. So strong in fact that spikes do not hurt him, which is very valuable in a number of situations. He is also very slow and has only a short leap. He has a powerful punch.

4. K.O. is the Mouse Lord. He is tiny which allows him to enter areas that other team members can not. He is also extremely fast and the highest jumper of the team. However, he is the weakest member so he can not sustain very much damage. He has the same wall and ceiling traversal abilities as Samson. Offensively, he can drop time-delay bombs.

When all 4 characters reach the emperor's palace, they all jump into Samson's bell. Actually, Gamm and K.O. quietly jump into Samson's bell; Kikira initially refuses. After a brief fight (with the player controlling Samson), Kikira joins the effort. Throughout the rest of the game, the player can switch between any of the 4 characters by entering the sub-screen. Each character has their own power meter. However, all the characters share lives. If the presently selected character loses all of his or her power, then one life is lost. The player must swap between all 4 characters in order to complete the journey.</desc>

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</desc>

		<name>The Lone Ranger</name>
		<desc>In the early 1880's in Texas, a man has returned to bring  justice to the outlaw who murdered his brother and his former comrades, the Texas Rangers. His name is the Lone Ranger. The outlaw, whose name is Butch Cavendish, has now kidnapped the President. The time has come for the masked man to begin his journey of adventure for the purpose of safely rescuing the President and avenging the deaths of his brother and former comrades.

The game takes you through 8 western-themed regions, each 
with a different objective, all of which brings you closer to your nemesis, Butch Cavendish. The game features many points of view during gameplay. Most of the time, the game is played from a top-down perspective, as you travel through the country and walk through towns. At other times, the game switches to a side scrolling view when you are in a boss stage. On occasion, the view switches to a first person perspective and plays similar to a first person shooter.

Each bad guy you kill is worth money. You can use money to buy more bullets, dynamite, rifles or a patch up from a doctor. For example, you start with a short barreled gun which you can upgrade to either a medium or long barreled gun. Your gun shoots standard bullets but can also fire silver bullets which are stronger than the standard ones.</desc>

		<name>M.U.L.E.</name>
		<desc>M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.

You start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.

Each turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.

After the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.

After the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus.

Third phase is the most interesting one: the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the price goes up and vice versa. This allows for interesting tactics, especially if one player manages to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted. 

There are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are:
- M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round plus the money to replace it.
- Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower.
- Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players).
- Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices.
- Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and decreasing energy production.
- Sunspot activity - increases energy production.
- Pest attack - eats all food on one plot.
- Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite plot.

M.U.L.E always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to play with four people around the computer. 

M.U.L.E is a very finely tuned game where rewards, penalties, time to use for various tasks etc. have been perfectly fine tuned to keep the game balanced. Rules and the random events mean that no two games are the same.</desc>

		<desc>Mach Rider is a motorcycle combat game set in a post-apocalyptic future. Players, represented by Mach Rider, must make their way across ten sectors to reach the city before it gets taken over by the enemy. Aggressive drivers try to force players off the road; obstacles, such as rocks, and the road's many turns also can cause players to veer off course. If destroyed, Mach Rider will reform himself so that he can continue.

There are three different play modes in Mach Rider.

On the Fighting Course, there are two paths to choose from. The goal must be reached while shooting down enemies or forcing them off the road; more points are rewarded by bumping off enemies. Unlimited lives are available for the first stage, but remaining courses must be finished in three lives or less.

On the Endurance and Solo Courses, there is a certain distance that must be gone before the time runs out. Enemies are on the Endurance Course, but the Solo course is devoid of enemies.

There is also a level editor (similar to the one in Excitebike) that allows creation of Endurance Course tracks, which are erased once the NES is turned off.</desc>

The elder Tatara saved him, build gadgets to replace his missing body parts and raised him together with his grandchild Kirin. On Madara's 15th birthday, when most of the world had already fallen to the Moki controlled by the Emperor Miroku, Madara sets out to find his real body and save the world from the Moki.

Mouryou Senki Madara is an RPG in which players control a party consisting of up two four characters exploring towns, dungeons and a world map from a top-down perspective. Battles occur randomly and the characters move and fight autonomously, although it is possible to pause battles at any time and order characters to fight, defend, use magic or items or flee. Furthermore, a basic battle strategy (attack, defend, stop or flee) can be selected from a tactics menu, where it is also possible to change the characters' starting formation.</desc>

While Golgo is outdoors, the game is a side-scrolling romp where the player can fire and jump. This changes when Golgo enters a building, at which point the game switches to a first person 3D maze. Navigating past soldiers and between floors, Golgo collects various clues to advance the storyline. There is also a driving sequence, and several sniper sequences in which precision aiming is required.

		<path>./Magic Carpet 1001 (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
		<name>Magic Carpet 1001</name>
		<desc>Magic Carpet 1001 (called "Arabian Nights" in Chinese) is an unlicensed shoot-'em-up developed by Mega Soft (NTDEC) and distributed by NTDEC in 1991, Caltron and Gluk Video in 1992 and Asder in 1993 as part of the Asder 20-in-1 multicart. Its Caltron 6-in-1 incarnation is arguably the most well-known.
The game is a standard NES shoot-'em-up. It is four levels long and mostly takes place in an Arabian setting, with the fourth level being in space. There are many enemies that stand in the way of your character (an Aladdin-type who rides a magic carpet, although the title screen suggests he is a genie) which follow set patterns that become more complex with each level.
As well as this, all four levels have a different boss; a witch, a snake in a flying jar, a giant skull and giant lips respectively, with the latter often being considered to be far too difficult. Numerous power-ups can be collected at random by wiping out a certain group of enemies before they disappear, with P power-ups upgrading your weapon, S power-ups increasing the player's speed, an icon of your character's face for an extra life and hearts giving you several hit points, and a magic lamp in the fourth level which maxes out your character's health. By default, your character starts with 6 lives, dies in one hit and he can only fire one shot on the screen at a time.
Oddly for a shooter, this game does not have a score system whatsoever and the levels progress with the only warning being that the screen fades out after the boss. The ending is a picture of your character and (presumably) the damsel in distress you were rescuing, followed by a credits screen which has some of the names that appear in other Mega Soft games.
This game was later hacked in 1995 to produce Aladdin III, which is identical apart from the title screen which removes the company name and logo, as well as decreasing protagonist's minimal speed. This one appears on several multicarts. It is also unrelated to the Hummer Team pirate.</desc>

In the 301, 501, and 701 games the point is to get the score down to exactly zero.
In Count up, the players compete to see who can achieve the highest score.
In Round the Clock, players must try to hit the numbers one  through twelve in sequential order.
In Half It, players begin with 40 points. Players have three chances to hit the assigned numbers to add to their own score. If the player is unable to hit all assigned numbers, their point total will be cut in half. The player with the highest score wins. The assigned numbers are 16, double ring, 17, 18,triple ring, 19, 20 and the bullseye.</desc>

Your team starts each game at a certain salary level. Your goal is to beat the opposition to earn a larger salary. Keep winning and you might etch your name onto the Big Earners Screen. Choose from five skill levels - Rookie to Professional. Each level provides quicker gameplay, tougher defense, and bigger bucks if you win.

Each game lasts four three-minute, real-life quarters. In between quarters, you can review stats such as field goal percentage, three-pointers made, rebounds, and steals. If the score is tied at the final buzzer, you play additional quarters until someone wins.

You control one player at a time. An arrow appears on-screen above the head of the player you're running. Just hit B to switch players. You can play against the computer or up to three friends.</desc>

However before the being conquered, a group of scientists has managed to create one last weapon and hidden it underground. The name of the weapon is Mag Max and only it might be able to defeat the alien invaders. Mag Max however is incomplete and for security reasons, his component parts are scattered across the land. Through their collection, Mag Max's strength increases.

Mag Max is a side-scrolling shooter game. At the beginning, Mag Max is only a tiny little fighter craft that can fire low-powered projectiles. As component pieces are found; such as a head, legs and a laser lance, Mag Max's offensive power increases. Access to the underworld can be granted through small dark craters on the landscape. Once in the underworld, Mag Max's weapons vary slightly as do the enemies (there are no stationary objects underground). Enemy fire or contact on each of the components will destroy that component. Fire on the main fighter will destroy Mag Max. At the end of each level awaits a boss creature.

The protagonist is a young man who recovers a mystical treasure box belonging to the Maharaja from the river Ganges. He is rewarded with a feast for recovering the item, but the princess warns him later the same night that the Maharaja's generosity is a ruse and that he is being controlled by an evil wizard and plans to kill the hero in the morning. The hero escapes the palace to look for a way to free the Maharaja and rescue the princess, acquiring the assistance of the gods along the way.

Speech and other descriptive text appears below the picture window. In addition, the player can also find themselves embroiled in random battles which play out like other turn-based RPGs of the era. The player can find and equip new gear as well as learn new spells as the game continues.

The game was never officially localized into English nor was it ever released outside of Japan. A fan translation was created in 2009, however.</desc>

But even if Godai makes it into the manager's room and tries to look at the framed photo, something will always happen which will force Godai to leave the room. Thus, after multiple attempts, Godai makes the (il)logical decision to gather photos of all the inhabitants of the boarding house to make Kyoko show him the photo. The game has the player move between locations in the boarding house and the town, constantly running out of money, and meeting all the cast from the original comic book, including Nikaido who did not appear in the anime.</desc>

		<desc>Baseball game featuring full major league rosters of all 26 teams of the 1987 baseball season.  The players, however, are never identified by name, only by jersey number.  Oddly enough, the statistics for the players are very close to, but not exactly, the same as their real-life counterparts.  Close enough that it is possible to identify who each player is supposed to be, though they are represented only by a position (infield/outfield/catcher/pitcher), a number, and a stat line.

There is no season mode, but you can play a regular season game, an All-Star Game (you pick your own All-Stars from the team rosters), or a World Series.

Before each game begins, you set your lineup and starting pitcher from your chosen team's roster.

Gameplay is the standard behind-the-catcher viewpoint for pitching and batting, switching to different views after the ball is hit.</desc>

Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.
nnPlayers start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as "OPEN Door"). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates.</desc>

		<desc>Mappy the mouse had a son named Happy. Happy has grown up and now wants to settle down with a wife. However, the girl he wants to marry won't agree to marriage until Happy can prove that he can provide for a family. So now it's up to Happy to collect a small fortune so he can please his would be spouse. Of course, the boss cat Nyamco and his legion of mukies stand in the way of making this an easy endeavor.

The game is a basic sidescrolling platformer. Happy can defeat his enemies by kicking them. He can also perform a jump, and while he's up in the air, he can spin his tail so he can glide in the air for a short period of time, which is useful for clearing large chasms. Littered throughout the levels are treasure boxes and coins which earn money for Happy, which in turn can be spent on items for domestic living. On the other hand, every time Happy is hit by an enemy, he loses some money, though a money bag will appear allowing Happy to recollect some of the lost money.

After each stage, Happy is presented with a slot machine ran by Nyamco. First, Happy spins the wheel to see a prize. Prizes range from extra lives to domestic items. Now, to actually win these  prizes, Happy must go up against one of the Mukies in a minigame. If he fails to win the minigame, he can be penalized by losing some money, domestic items, or even a life. Minigames include waving flags by following Nyamco's orders. There's also a  minigame where Happy stands back to back with a mukie and they try to push each other off a platform.  The other minigame involves trying to spot more differences in a picture than the opponent can.

After the minigame is over, Happy goes to a shop, where he can purchase items for his house. Buying these items will prove to the bride to be that Happy is worth marrying.

The two player game has both players, (one playing as Happy, the other as his brother Rappy), competing against each other to collect the most assets to prove their worth as a suitable husband.</desc>

		<desc>Bowser, the token bad guy from the Mario Bros. series, is up to no good again in this educational game designed to teach children geography. This time he's set up his headquarters in Antarctica and created portals to 25 famous cities around the world, so that his Koopas can wreak havoc in our own world. He's also kidnapped Mario, hence the title of this game. You play as Luigi who must foil Bowser's plans by entering through each of the portals, tracking down the Koopas who have stolen famous artifacts, and looking for clues about your location. Once you've set everything right and determined where you are, you call Yoshi on your Globulator so he can track you down. You need Yoshi's help to eat the Pokey (a cactus-like creature) that's guarding the return portal, and when Luigi returns he can close the portal forever.

By exploring these 25 cities, children can familiarize themselves with the landmarks and artifacts that each city has. When Luigi returns the stolen artifacts to the proper places he can even take photographs of them. There is also an add-on disk you can purchase that adds ten additional cities to the game (it originally retailed for $24.95).

		<name>Kamen No Ninja - Hanamaru</name>
		<desc>Kamen no Ninja Hanamaru is a side-scrolling platform game by Capcom. Hanamaru, a ninja boy in training, is sent on a mission to investigate bizarre happenings and disappearances. In a local theme park called Leisure Island, children have been mysteriously disappearing and these disappearances are being attributed to a ruthless rival gang of ninjas. Equipped with his red mask and a mechanical hawk, it is up to the brave Hanamaru to journey throughout the park's fourteen areas and to rescue the captive children. The young ninja can run, jump or allow his hawk companion to attack enemies at long range. He can also collect special scrolls to increase his magic powers and cast various spells (press Down and B to activate them) - they range from lightning attack (kills all enemies on screen), ground shake (kills all enemies on the ground), Fire Hawk (unleashes the hawk super dive attack) and super jump (increases jumping speed for a short amount of time). Various special items are also available throughout the game, such as extra lives, invincibility and battle cards. Battle cards are a very important part of the gameplay - every now and then, Hanamaru encounters a boss that he must fight in a really unusual way (and apparently loosely based on the traditional Japanese disciplines of Ninjutsu). Boss battles are round based, and the player must pick a card with a higher face value than his opponent, and the difference represents how much damage the player (or the boss) takes. Thankfully, Hanamaru can collect special battle cards along the way - some can double or triple the face value of a card, whereas others prevent the boss from being able to attack for a round, or help Hanamaru regain some life. Although most of the game offers traditional side scrolling platformer action, several levels try out very different gameplay styles (Hanamaru can ride a Skateboard in some stages, or fly through the air with the help of his hawk companion).</desc>

Venice Beach Volleyball
Stakk'M (never released outside of this multicart)
Deathbots

Stakk'M is a Tetris like game that uses falling square blocks with either numerals, hearts, or diamonds patterns on them. The player tries to create either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines of 3 to 5 identical or consecutive numbers to score points and eliminate them from the well. Each level has a goal that must be met in order to move on to the next level. Goals involve completing a set number of horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines, scoring a stated number of points, or eliminating a certain number of blocks at once by using any combination of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines. There are also treasure blocks which act as wild cards and death blocks which can only be eliminated by combining them with other death blocks.

The HES version of this game does away with Pyramid and Double Strike and adds the following games in their place:

1. BlackJack
Death Race

		<name>Mechanized Attack</name>
		<desc>Mechanized Attack is an adaptation of an arcade shooting game where the player uses a machine gun to stage an assault on a tropical island that's home to a cyborg army. In this NES port, the player can use either a gamepad or the NES Light Zapper to carry out the mission. Battle through numerous stages beginning with an approach to the island. This first stage is held over the water and features at attack on a number of small gunboats, a helicopter, and an entire battleship. As the player progresses through the stages of the island, the human (and even canine) enemies are revealed to be robots when the flesh is destroyed. At various junctures of the game, the player is allowed to choose which game path to pursue.

While the arcade version of Mechanized Attack had a miniature machine gun replica for the player to use, this NES adaptation attempts to reproduce the feel by allowing the player to hold down a game pad button or the Light Zapper trigger for automatic fire. Extra ammo is plentiful so be sure to fire at those power-up boxes to grab as much as you can. There are also more powerful grenades which are in much shorter supply than the bullets.</desc>

At the forefront of this technology is Dr. Light and his assistant Dr. Wily, who are commissioned to build six robots to handle a variety of specific tasks. They are named Bombman, Gutsman, Iceman, Cutman, Elecman, and Fireman in reference to their individual prime functions. Dr. Wily, however, has bigger plans and chooses to take control of the robots and let loose destruction in a bid for world control. Dr. Light fights back with the best tool he has, an experimental human-like robot, Rock aka Mega Man, who had been tested to perform cleaning duties. Now properly armed, it's up to Mega Man to take on the maverick robots, fight his way into Dr. Wily's castle, and end this madness.</desc>

Dr. Wily has escaped from prison and is madder than ever, this time creating eight new Robot Masters of his own to take over the world and crush Mega Man!  Is the world doomed?

Mega Man 2 is the sequel to the NES game Mega Man. In this game, Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man and Wood Man are Dr. Wily's eight prize creations that have been sent to take over the world.  As Mega Man defeats these bosses, he can steal their powers and use them for himself.  Each Robot Master is weak against another's weapon, and through experimentation, Mega Man can gain the upper hand by using the weapon they're vulnerable against.

Other additions to the game include the 'E-Tank' - an item that can be used at any time to completely refill Mega Man's energy, and a Password System, which allows players to continue their game by recording which Robot Masters have been defeated and how many E-Tanks they have.  Mega Man 2 also removes the scoring system from the original game.</desc>

		<desc>"Calling Mega Man! Calling Mega Man! Come in please! ...."

This is a traditional action-platformer: you jump from brick to brick while avoiding pits and shooting robots. It's quite similar, in all respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely walking. Also, there is a mysterious character called Protoman who may or may not be your friend.

Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the water(you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities function just like boss weapons.

How do those work, you ask? When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter. There are 8 of these, corresponding to the 8 main levels, even though there are 21 levels in the entire game. The bosses are as follows: Snake Man, Gemini Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, Top Man, Magnet Man, &amp;amp; Hard Man.

Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. You'll definitely want some of these for Dr. Wily's fortress, if not for the levels before it, since you start the game with only 3 lives. There are even Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find. And, of course, you do get infinite continues and a password feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.</desc>

		<desc>Dr. Cossack, humbled by his defeat and his allowing of Dr. Wily to influence his ways, decides to help Dr. Light by providing him and Rockman with tools and weapons to help foil Dr. Wily for good. All seems calm and peaceful, until...

A sudden rampage breaks out, and the cause is found to be a group of robots, led by a mysterious figure. As Dr. Light begins to investigate this rampage and attempts to find a way to stop it, he is kidnapped by the leader of the robots. Rockman hurries to save Dr. Light, but is too late...the only thing he can find at the scene is a yellow scarf...one that almost seems to belong to...Blues!?

Could Rockman's supposed brother, the strange but good-hearted Blues, be the one who kidnapped Dr. Light? Is Blues the one responsible for the rampages? With these questions racing through his mind, Rockman sets off to find Blues and get the answers he wants.

Like the other early Rockman / Mega Man games, the Playstation version was only released in Japan, as part of the Complete Works series.</desc>

		<desc>Meimon! Daisan Yakyuubu ("Meimon! The Third Baseball Club") is a baseball sim for the Famicom that is based on a manga and anime of the same name about an underdog high school baseball team and the drama that surrounds them. The player can access the game's story mode, which depicts scenes from the manga, by selecting "Dramatic Mode" from the title screen menu. This also adds character portraits to the main game mode. The game itself is a fairly standard NES baseball game. The pitching/batting perspective is from directly behind the batter, and the player moves the entire group of fielders simultaneously whenever the ball is hit. Graphically, the many super-deformed athletes resemble those of Namco's Famista (the series upon which RBI Baseball was based), which was very much the leading baseball franchise at the time.</desc>

		<desc>Meimon! Takonishi Ouendan (usually localized as "The West Tako Cheerleaders", but literally translates to "Prestigious School! West Tako Cheerleading Squad") is a Famicom strategy game based on the manga of the same name about a young man who joins his school's intimidating cheerleading squad. In 1987, this same property also saw a live-action movie adaptation.

The game has players moving characters around a city map and fighting rival ouendan teams for dominance. Combat occurs whenever two units meet on the map and cuts to a timing-based mini-game where the player has to input a command before their opponent's fist reaches the current character's profile. The closer the fist gets, the more likely it is that the enemy gets in their attack before the player can. Stronger attacks are listed further down the menu, increasing the risk vs. reward factor as the player scrambles to execute them in time.

After winning a map, the player's party can gain levels and acquire new special attacks, which show up in the attack menu on rare occasions and are very powerful.</desc>

		<name>Mermaids of Atlantis : The Riddle of the Magic Bubble</name>
		<desc>Mermaids of Atlantis is a censored localization of the formerly pornographic game Bubble Bath Babes (also known as Magic Bubble or Soap Panic) with all nudity removed. Instead of showing erotic images after stages are cleared, this version of the game has cutscenes describing how the greedy emperor O-Dinten sealed the merpeople's games in protective bubbles and forces them pay licensing fees. You must solve puzzles to unlock the games, as an allegory of the real-life situation with Nintendo's lockout chip making it difficult to release unlicensed games for the NES.

The gameplay is reminiscent of that of Tetris and Puzzle Bobble in that the goal is to steer clusters of rising bubbles and place them so that they connect to other bubbles of similar color along the top of the screen. If the sufficient number of similar bubbles are touching, they will be cleared and all free neighboring bubbles will rise further, allowing for combos. If the accumulated bubbles on screen reach the bottom of the playing area, the game is over. If a level is completed, the player will be rewarded with erotica.

The game is very difficult to find and is sought after by collectors, often topping prices of $1000 U.S. Dollars on auction sites such as eBay.</desc>

The commands the player can choose varies between context, which usually ranges from talking to supporting characters to investigating the surrounding. The player must explore every possible option in order for new choices to appear.

The player can quit at any point of the game and continue later via a password feature.
The game takes place eight years after a great war was waged between colonies in outer space, and peace has finally settled back onto the Earth. The main character, a 17-year-old war orphan named Tadashi Himukai, purchases a used worker-mech in order to start a construction business with his girlfriend, Elina Furfa. However, when he first activates it, the worker-mech disguise falls away, revealing a combat model Metal Slader, which were all supposedly dismantled after the war, and an enigmatic message is displayed in the cockpit: "EARTH IN PERIL... SEEK THE CREATOR". Prompted by this warning, Tadashi, his sister Azusa, and Elina head out into space to find the answers behind it.
It was the final game released by HAL Laboratory as an independent third-party developer before their buy-out by Nintendo. The game's story and character designs were done by manga artist Yoshimiru Hoshi, who loosely based the game on his 1984 manga Akûtensô Fixallia</desc>

The overall goal is to keep playing each machine, winning either through a determined strategy or simple perseverance, until all the machines have been emptied of their contents.

Goofy assists with chauffeur and data processing duties. Mickey can venture into any of the following 6 territories: Yukon, Swamp, Forest, Jungle, Pyramid, and Caribbean. In each area, his mission is to collect three diamonds that contain letters. Doing so will spell a word. Then, Mickey ventures to the end of the level and collects a large slab. If Mickey collects the three diamonds in the stage to spell a 3-letter word, Mickey spells the word with digitized audio samples and says the word, complete with an illustration. Then, the slab that Mickey collected at the end of the stage is fed by Goofy through a large machine that spits out a letter. It is up to the player to identify which letter this is.

This game is oriented towards very young children. As such, it is essentially impossible to fail. There are many enemies in the game but none actually inflict harm. Snakes, porcupines, hippos, alligators, and even baby seals-- Mickey just bounces off each. Mickey can also swim handily and sustain long falls.

Further, the game allows the player to point at letters on a board and have Mickey say them using the cartridge's library of digitized mouse voice samples.</desc>

		<desc>In Might and Magic, the player controls a party of adventurers in a medieval world called Varn. Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact an impostor, a creature from outer space. Your task is to find the real king and ultimately to stop the alien invasion into Varn.

This is the first game in the  Might and Magic series, and one of the prototypes of role-playing games in general. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. The player creates a party of six adventurers, with traditional classes to choose from (fighter, cleric, etc.). The player also specifies the gender and the age of the characters - they grow old and will eventually die of natural causes. As in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world, performing quests, and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The turn-based battles typically take place against six monsters, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain.

		<desc>The sequel to the original Bomb Jack, Mighty Bombjack brings side scrolling to the series, and brings it closer to a platform game rather than the arcade / puzzle likeness of the first one.

Once again you play as the bomb-hungry caped superhero. Collect the bombs for points and avoid being touched by the different monsters that spawn from crates and the like.

The game now features new scenarios like clouds and forests, as well as the usual sphinx and pyramids backgrounds of the original title.

		<name>Mighty Final Fight</name>
		<desc>Capcom's only 8-bit port of the Final Fight series, Mighty Final Fight follows the storyline and characters of the first Final Fight game. Mayor of Metro City Mike Haggar, his ninja friend Guy and his daughter's boyfriend, Cody learn that Haggar's daughter, Jessica,  has been kidnapped by the Mad Gear Gang whose leader has fallen in love with her, and also wants the meddling Mike Haggar to leave town. Now it's personal! Choosing one of the three fighters, the player embarks on a beat-em-up quest through the streets of Metro City.

The game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up and a one-player only game (unlike other Final Fight ports). Also exclusive to this particular Final Fight game is the experience system which allows gaining levels to learn additional moves, similar to the first Double Dragon game. The characters have all been squished down to super-deformed 8-bit likenesses.  Graphically this looks similar to River City Ransom. Each character has a button for attack and a button for jumping. Pressing the two together unleashes a character-specific super-move. Various grabbing moves and throws can also be done by moving the player near an enemy.</desc>

		<desc>Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger is a video game based off the Super Sentai series of the same name. It was released for the Family Computer (or Famicom; known outside Japan as the Nintendo Entertainment System) by Angel Studios, and published by Toei. It is a side-scrolling action game in which the player takes control of a different Zyurangers in each of the game's five stages. The game includes two difficulty settings and a password feature.

The player begins the game as Boi in the first stage, followed by Mei, Dan, Goushi and Geki in subsequent stages. Each Zyuranger begins his or her stage wielding the standard Ranger Gun, which can be replaced with the character's corresponding Legendary Weapon by finding the entrance to Barza's room in each stage. Each stage also contain ten scattered coins which will replenish the player's life gauge completely when fully collected, as well display a still of the character's mecha and its specifications. At the end of each stage, the player will confront one of the main villains from the show. The villains faced are Pleprechuan, Tottpatt, Bookback, Grifforzer, and Bandora herself.

Between stages, the player will be challenged to one of three possible minigames by Burai the Dragonranger. These consist of a trivia game where Bandora will ask the player a question related to the TV series, a Pong-style game between DaiZyujin and the Dragon Caesar, and a hot potato-style game between GÅryÅ«zin and Lamy. These minigames are also accessible from the main menu and can be played with a second player.</desc>

		<desc>Mike Tyson's Punch-Out is one of the most popular and biggest selling video games of all time. Step into the ring as Little Mac, a 17-year-old fighter from the Bronx, ranked number three in the minor circuit. Your goal is to work your way up through the rankings so that you can challenge Mike Tyson, Kid Dynamite, in a dream fight. 

But the road to the championship is long and hard. You'll have to work your way up through the minor, major, and world circuits by winning against tough contestants like Piston Honda, Glass Joe, Super Macho Man and many, many more! Defeat all your opponents and meet the ultimate challenge against the World Heavyweight Champion Mike Tyson in the greatest fight of all - The Dream Bout! Knockout Tyson and you can become WVBA (World Video Boxing Association) Champ!

The rules of the World Video Boxing Association govern your bouts. Each match is three three-minute rounds long. Any boxer knocked down for a 10 count is Knocked Out (KO). If a boxer goes down three times, he'll find himself a Technical Knock Out (TKO). If both boxers make it to the end of the third round, the ref determines the winner. 

Once you're in the ring you'll have to beat your opponent with smart fighting. Use left and right punches, as well as uppercuts to knock your opponent to the mat. Dodge your opponent's blows with some fancy footwork. Dazzle them with your brilliance and you'll be the World Video Boxing Association Champion. On the other hand, you might find yourself down for the count.

But there are other insects as well; spiders, bees, dragonflies and earwigs. Nature is dangerous. Luckily, there's a bug zapper that can shoot arrows at these insects and destroy them.

Millipede is the sequel to Centipede, and features similar gameplay, but with a new swarm of insects! The goal is to destroy the multi-segmented millipede as it traverses its way through the mushroom forest towards the bottom of the screen. When all millipede segments have been destroyed, the player will progress to the next, more difficult level. Millipedes and other creatures are all worth a different amount of points. Occasionally dynamite will appear on the screen, which will explode if shot by the bug zapper. With a well timed shot, numerous millipede segments (and other insects as well) can be taken out as they pass by.</desc>

		<desc>Mindseeker is an adventure game from Namco that tests the player's extra sensory perception and latent psychic ability. It features Japanese TV psychic Masuaki Kiyota, who is best known in his native land for a spoon-bending act similar to that of Israeli psychic Uri Geller.
The player can explore the world using two commands: Feel and Exit. Exit will simply move the player character to a new area, while Feel is how the player interacts with the various objects and people in the world; for the purposes of the game, the term "feel" is analogous to "sense". The player is also able to input their own name upon starting the game. As well as the adventure game elements, much of the game involves playing mini-games designed to test the player's psychic ability, such as a card game where the player must guess which symbol will appear next.</desc>

		<desc>Minelvaton Saga: Ragon no Fukkatsu is a Role Playing Game first in the Minelvaton series, being followed by Silva Saga and ending with Silva Saga II: The Legend of Light and Darkness.
Minelvaton Saga takes place on the world Minelvaton, in the area known as Southern Ofelia. In the kingdom of Palmeccia both the King and Queen have been murdered by the hands of a servant of Ragon, son of the Zuhl. The player takes control of the Prince of Palmeccia in a quest for revenge and to kill the evil Ragon.
Fundamentally, the game plays and looks like Dragon Quest. The player is given control of a single character and can explore a number of towns, dungeons, and the world map itself. However, once the player receives the ship for sailing, the game becomes non-linear as the player can explore almost anywhere that can be reached.
Another unique feature is the battle system. Like a typical RPG, there are random battles, but actual combat resembles a sort of action RPG. In battle, the player starts at the bottom of the screen facing the enemies that are at the top. In order to defeat enemies, the player must run into one in order to exchange blows. The closest analog to this unusual system is the MMORPG, or the MMORPG-ish single player game Final Fantasy XII.
Beyond that, the basic plot and some of the battle system concept seems to have been co-opted by Sega's Sword of Vermilion.</desc>

		<desc>Mini Putt is a miniature golf game that offers 4 courses, Deluxe, Classic, Traditional and Challenge. Up to 4 players can either play a game or practice any hole on any course. Each course offers its own difficulty level. Deluxe and Challenge have difficult hills and course layouts. The Challenge being the more difficult course. The Classic offers animated bridges and other obstacles. The traditional is your standard miniature golf course which requires well placed bank shots.

To make a shot, using the joystick, move the crosshair in the approximate direction and distance where you wish the ball to go. When you are ready to shoot, hit the fire button. You will notice the level rise in the power bar. When the bar reaches the desired distance, press the fire button again. When you release the fire button, the bar starts to move back down. The mark where you stopped the bar moving indicates the power with which you hit the ball. When the bar reaches the bottom of the power bar, it moves horizontally on the accuracy bar. In the middle of the accuracy bar is the center line. Too much to the left of center, it pulls to the left. Too much to the right of center, it pulls to the right. Press the fire button at the right moment to hit the ball. If the course proves to be too tough, visit the Practice course option. Not all of us can be a pro.</desc>

As you fight your way through each area, you must obtain information and vital ID cards.  Your progress is blocked at every turn by acid flames, raw sewage, scorching steam, high voltage electricity and poison gas.

You can choose from three agents, Max, Grant and Nicholas, according to the situation at hand.  Each is equipped with two types of weapons which can be interchanged according to the surroundings.

If an agent's life gauge runs out the next agent in line will take his place.  If you complete an area successfully then the knocked-out agents will rejoin the team at the beginning of the next area.

The game is made up of six areas with the first and last consisting of two stages.  Two of the areas auto-scroll with all three agents in play at once.

This game will self destruct in five seconds.

		<name>Momotarou Densetsu Gaiden</name>
		<desc>The game is based on famous Japanese folk tales. Momotarou is a boy who was found in a huge peach (hence his name, "peach guy"). When he grows up, he goes to the island of demons, fights them, takes their treasure, and restores peace in its village. In this game, you don't play directly the story of Momotarou, but control three other popular characters from Japanese folklore, playing three separate stories: as Yashahime, the daughter of the Hell King Emma; Binbougami, or "poverty god", who is hated by people because he takes money from them; and Urashima, the legendary fisherman who once saved a turtle and became friends with the dragon clan. Although the original stories have nothing or little to do with each other or the story of Momotarou, the game ties the stories together by featuring Momotarou as a character in every one of them.

Despite being primarily a game for kids (the story is told in a fairy-tale fashion), this is a full-fledged console-style RPG with levels, party management, world map traveling, dungeons, towns, weapons and armors, and turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies, viewed from first person perspective.

Warlock didn't let his size impairment get in the way of world domination, however, so it's up to The Vampire and The Monster to stop him! Along the way, both characters will have to fight through Warlock's henchmonsters through the streets, sewers, a construction area and even a Japanese garden.

The game features classic platforming action. The player only has one all-purpose attack and they can also double jump to avoid enemies or reach high ledges. The player can also pick up small objects and use them to attack several enemies at once. If there's only one player, they can choose between The Vampire or The Monster. Or if they don't want to go alone, a friend can join in and help them beat Warlock in the two player co-op mode.

The game is based on the Monster In My Pocket toy franchise. The package also included a limited edition Monster in My Pocket toy, Blemmyea (#81), which was only available with this game.</desc>

In the hill climb, players race on a track comprised mainly of steep hills. The drag race event offers drag racing down a long straight way. The bog event is a race on a track with numerous watery bogs throughout its path. In the car crush event, the player races up and down straight roadways, driving over rows of cars that are lined up for the monster truck to crush. In the tug-o-war competition, the player's truck and the one of the opponent are tied together, facing opposite directions, and the player has to tug the other across the line that is on your own side behind hum. The sled pull has the player drive along a straight path while pulling a weighted sled. While progressing, more weight is added, slowing the truck down. The draw bridge course features drawbridges that go up and down. If the bridge is down, the truck can pass, if it is up, the player has to wait until it comes back down to continue. Donut features races around a small donut-shaped track against an opponent. The combo course event involves all the previous events thrown in throughout a race,

Players can also create your own track or have the game create one at random.</desc>

The game also gives you extensive editing options, giving you the opportunity to create a board setup of your liking, placing the ShÅgi pieces wherever you want. The game also lets a player interrupt a current game and go back and forth through the moves.</desc>

		<name>Mottomo Abunai Deka</name>
		<desc>Mottomo Abunai Deka is an action game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game is based on a Japanese TV drama show.

The game is a 2D 1-2 player side scroller. You the player control Taka or Yuuji, or both of these characters at the same time. You'll find yourself up against many enemies of the Yakuza gang, ?The Silver Stars?, and then later on leading you to corruption within the police department and to the main villain at the end. While playing the game you'll also run into three mini-games, which are a shooting gallery, a fast paced car ride and a shootout with one of the boss enemies.

While playing the side scrolling part of this game, if you want to switch weapons, press start and then A to cycle through the selection.

The original name of the game is Mottomo Abunai Deka, which has been retitled as The Most Dangerous Detectives.

All of the text has been translated to the best of my knowledge. The main issue with the text is that there is a scrolling issue that has been worked out as best as possible for now.</desc>

		<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

Miss Piggy has been "pignapped" by the sinister Dr. Grump; her Muppet friends come to the rescue. Kermit, Gonzo, Fozzie and three other characters from the children's TV show dash into Grump's mysterious fun fair in search for their pink companion. They must brave five rides in succession in order to take on the Grumpasaurus in the final carnival confrontation.

1. Tunnel of Love: Avoid objects in the waterway
2. Duck Hunt: Hit passing ducks with tomatoes
3. Space Ride: Land a spaceship in the correct dock using rocket blasts
4. Bumper Cars: Race around the track and avoid crashing into obstacles
5. Funhouse: Find a way through a small maze filled with guard dogs
6. Battle of the Grumpasaurus: Tickle the Grumpasaurus so that he laughs himself silly

The C-64, Apple II and DOS versions of Chaos at the Carnival support two players, taking turns.

The versions for the four platforms differ strongly; see the trivia section for details.

This is a board game for one player (no human or computer opponents). You start as an angel in heaven. Your number is drawn at random, which means that you are the next angel to be delivered to Earth to become a human being. You start as a child and live your whole life (dying at 100). Throughout the game, you will do your best to improve your statistics in six categories: knowledge, health, friendship, love, popularity and wealth. You will be ranked among the Japanese population to see how well you are doing in six categories. Japan has a population of 130 million. You will then start at #130,000,000 and try to get to #1. The entire course is very long. You can expect to play it for about 50 hours, and that's as long as you win on the first try. You will not do this on your own. Reaching #1 in the ranking is not easy.</desc>

The game plays like a standard action-based platformer. The levels feature plenty of enemies and gaps you must jump over. Your only weapon are sticks of dynamite. When you throw a stick, it will bounce off the floor and explode only after a couple of seconds, so very precise aiming and timing are needed to defeat the enemies. Many levels contain optional treasure chests as well as hidden doors that lead to bonus levels. Sometimes level progression is non-linear, i.e. you can jump straight to a high-numbered zone if you find the correspondent door on the level. All the levels are timed. The protagonist dies when he falls into a pit, touches an enemy, or runs out of time.</desc>

In August that same year, BrÃ¸derbund announced that it would be released for the North American NES console as The Battlefields of Napoleon; which was eventually cancelled.

This video game allows the player to re-enact the Napoleonic Wars using a bird's-eye view. Starting with earliest battles against the Holy Roman Empire to grab territory for the fledging French Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars in the year 1796, Napoleon would guide the French Revolutionary Wars until they ended in 1802. All the nations that were a participant in the Napoleonic Wars were included like Czarist Russia, Great Britain, and the Spanish Empire. Napoleon's first in-game battle would located in present-day Italy; making the battle equally important in Italian history as it was in French history. There are also battles in what would now considered to be the Arab Republic of Egypt against the Ottoman Empire along with various other conquests in Europe.</desc>

		<name>NARC</name>
		<desc>Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the "E" indicates the exit.

Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.

More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?</desc>

This is shown clearly when you choose to play 2 or more players. Then you can choose between many different ground layers, like ice, grass and stone, which adds to the replayability.

When you play a one player game you play the world cup as one of the top soccer countries of that time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. Cameroon in the first match and the final is against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time whatsoever.

In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee. Probably it was made this way to be funnier to play against friends.</desc>

Seeing as how the characters are gang members, fighting and beating your opponents can be a viable way of winning the challenges, so several weapons and power-ups can also be found in the courses</desc>

Gameplay is from two point of views, starting with an overhead view allowing you to set up the shot and choose a club, then switching to a 3-D point of view. Hitting the ball uses the common power meter where tapping the button starts the meter, tap the button a second time to select the amount of power in the shot, then tap the button a third time to select the amount of slice or hook. If you are unable to finish a round in one play, NES Open Tournament Golf features a battery back-up allowing you to save the game and continue later.</desc>

		<name>NES Play Action Football</name>
		<desc>Nintendo takes its game to the gridiron with NES Play Action Football.  While Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989 season.  You can even substitute second-stringers for the "skill" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.

Play perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen.  Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run.  The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from.  The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.

Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.  There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout "First Down!" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains.  Team stats are displayed on a summary screen after every quarter of play.  Highest scoring team wins, which in playoffs mode means moving on to the next round--and an eventual shot at winning it all in the Power Bowl!</desc>

		<name>New Ghostbusters 2</name>
		<desc>New Ghostbusters II follows loosely the original Ivan Reitman's film plot. You start out by selecting two ghostbusters out of  five (The 5th one is Louis Tully). The first, player controlled buster will use proton pack and second, controlled by AI, uses the trap where ghosts end up, after been freezed by using the proton pack. Player controlled buster can get hurt, if touched by a ghost, while AI buster can't. 

The game's perspective is Top-Down, where you move from a one room to another and get rid of ghosts. The type of ghosts vary. After every level you have to fight against a boss, usually someone from the movie. For example, in the first courthouse level you fight against the Scoleri brothers. 

The game contains six levels, inspired by the movie:The Courthouse
2. Subways
3. Apartment
4. The Underground
5. The Museum of Art

The player is in control of the action from a side-scrolling perspective. The camera also zooms in for closeups on receiving plays. However, NFL is also a very strategic, coaching-oriented take on the sport, featuring large playbooks (team plays are included on a separate fold-out sheet bundled with the game manual, but not onscreen in the game itself), limited customization of team skills, and penalties.</desc>

The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps.

Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices – pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.</desc>

		<name>A Nightmare on Elm Street</name>
		<desc>LJN's NES version of the classic horror series casts the player as a teen searching the houses on Elm Street for Freddy Krueger's bones. Once they are all collected, they must be thrown into the high school  furnace to destroy Freddy once and for all (a plot similar to 1987's A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors).

Nightmare has two worlds. In the red-tinted "real world," players fight snakes and spiders while navigating standard platform challenges. The players here have a "sleep meter" that depletes with every hit taken. If the player's sleep meter drops to empty, the game transitions into the blue-tinted "dream world," where enemies take on the appearance of skeletons and ghosts. An invisible timer also starts, counting down until Freddy appears and forces the player into a brief boss battle. The sleep meter becomes a standard life gauge in the dream world, and deducts a life from the player if drained.

Players can find and collect three different icons in the dream world to become "Dream Warriors" with special powers and projectile attacks - both of which give a significant edge when fighting Freddy. Collecting all the bones in a level takes the player to a final level boss, usually taking the form of a monster with Freddy's face or trademark razor glove. Players move back and forth down Elm Street, and a new house opens up as the previous one is cleared.

Nightmare is compatible with the NES Four Score accessory, allowing up to four players to play at once using the same screen.</desc>

Ninja Crusaders is a side-scrolling action game that can be played alone or with 2 players fighting side by side. A ninja player can jump quite high and begins the game with a ninja throwing star weapon that can travel the length of the screen, although it's not very powerful. Other weapons are available for the taking throughout the levels, each with considerably less range than the stars but with more power. These weapons include a chain whip, a sword, and a bo staff.

When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.

Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.

Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.</desc>

Some time has passed since the defeat of Ashtar and the resurrected Jaquio, and Irene Lew has received a new mission to complete. She is to observe a strange factory that has been constructed recently for an unknown purpose, and investigate it. She proceeds to reconnoiter it, but is intercepted and apparently assassinated by her friend Ryu Hayabusa...except it isn't Ryu. It is an imposter. The real Ryu, angered over her death, and the subsequent false accusation that he murdered her, continues her mission and proceeds to investigate the factory.

As stated, this was the last game in the regular series produced for the NES. It had many features the previous games in the series did not, such as a power up to extend the length of your sword, a new vertical "wave" attack and vertically-scrolling levels. The US version of the game is reputed to be the hardest in the series, due to the extra damage incurred when hit, slightly shorter regular sword length, limited continues and more enemies.

The Lynx port is the second Ninja Gaiden game on the platform, the first being a port from the Arcade Version. This port is identical to the NES game, but the in-game picture is compressed for the smaller screen of the Lynx.

		<name>Squashed</name>
		<desc>The game opens on a vegetative theme: siblings Maru and Cori are sent to bed early for not eating their vegetables, whereupon they drift off to sleep and dream together. Suddenly, a spaceship crashes before them! "Lettuce check it out," urges Maru. From the ship appears a man dressed as a king. "I yam King Kale," he says, "Won't you peas peas help me?" Yes, the flaccid puns start to fly from this point and don't let up until the very end of the game. Those expecting witty dialogue from this game obviously have never spoken to a game programmer before.

It seems that King Kale needs the pair's help to prevent six worlds from being dominated by a mysterious being known as Vegetron. Every hero needs a nemesis, right? Unfortunately, despite managing to look almost evil in a cute way, Vegetron fails to come across as a threat to our heroes. One wonders how he even managed to dominate his back garden, let alone six planets, with his army of cute robots and "vegetable-themed" guardian minions, the latter of which are vulnerable in the same spots and which can be dispatched with almost the same pattern on each world. This is the same Vegetron who, after a single defeat at the hands of Maru, realizes the error of his ways and chooses to turn over a new leaf in a platitudinous soliloquy which goes on and on. That puts an end to Veggie's chances of reappearing in sequels without some kind of contrived plot twist.

Our two heroes, then, set off on an adventure to save the kings imprisoned by the boss guardians on each of the six worlds. This being a platform game, each world has its own theme and pitfalls that need to be dealt with. These include the anti-gravity of the Space Fortress, fire pits of the Hot Pepper Planet, black holes of the Star-Spngled [sic] Squash, and requisite icy madness of the Frozen Vegetable Section. There is also a seventh world where the final battle with Vegetron takes place.</desc>

		<desc>In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate. 

Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.

In each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.

As the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a "boss". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.

Items can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.

The items in this game are:

1. Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.

2. Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!

3. Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.

4. Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.

5. Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.
2. Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!

6. Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.

7. Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.</desc>

		<desc>Ninja Kid is a side-scrolling action game in which the eponymous kid must jump and shoot his way through a series of different levels in order to complete his quest. The assorted levels include the Poison Field, Guerrila Warfare, and Blazing Inferno. While armed with ninja bullets by default, he occasionally has the opportunity to pick up other offensive items such as ninja stars, boomerangs, or fireballs. Enemies obstructing Ninja Kid's quest include rolling eyeballs, crows, flying demons, Frankenstein monsters, and of course, other ninjas.

The game begins in an overhead map that allows the player to wander into various side-scrolling levels. The levels go on an on until the player completes a particular task that makes a door appear. Going through the door sometimes leads outside to the overhead map and sometimes leads to a boss battle.

In Japan, this game was known as Gegege no Kitaro: Yokaidaimakyo, based on an animated TV series.</desc>

The second game played is Course 1 of Rad Racer, using the 328 Twin Turbo vehicle. The player must finish the course as quickly as possible. No clock is shown in the game but the cartridge keeps track internally. After finishing Rad Racer, its score is displayed, multiplied by 10 and added to the previous Super Mario Bros. score.

Last up is Nintendo's Tetris in A-type mode. All remaining time for the Championship is played out here. The player's objective is simply to get the best score. The Tetris score is multiplied by 25 and added to the previous Super Mario Bros. and Rad Racer scores.

After all the time runs out, a screen will display "Time!" and display the final score, a sum of the previous scores and their multipliers.</desc>

		<desc>In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes.  Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</desc>

He rescues starving creatures, to whom he gives parts of his head to eat, and fights the evil Baikinman ("Germ Man") and his minions.

This game contains five mini-games, some of which have educational purposes. The game is controlled entirely by a special mouse-like device which is shipped with it. The mini-games are:

1. Try to catch the apples Anpanman drops from the sky by running around a small field.

2. Combine puzzle pieces together to create images of the animé's characters.

3. Practice to write Japanese syllables (hiragana) with the help of Anpanman.

4. Figure out the differences between similar pictures.

5. Uncover characters' faces by clicking on empty spaces on a board. Uncovering an enemy's face will make you fail (a concept not unlike  Minesweeper).</desc>

("Drop Down Puzzle Tonjan?!", sometimes known as simply Tonjan) is a puzzle game from NMK that features anthropomorphic pigs pushing mahjong tiles around in a maze, attempting to push entire stacks down one of the many holes in the area. Bonus points are awarded for pushing certain specified tiles into holes first, and there's one tile in particular that will complete the level once pushed down a hole and is the only compulsory target. Future levels increase the number of tiles and the difficulty, adding fish tiles that cause the player to lose a life if they are pushed down a hole.
Okkotoshi Puzzle Tonjan!? appears to a sequel to NMK's earlier Arcade multiplayer action game Butasan, which features similar looking pigs. The rights to the Arcade version of Tonjan were sold to a Korean company, Dooyong, which turned it into a game named Yam! Yam?! featuring a tanooki wearing an apron.</desc>

It is a "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades.  Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds.
You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, ... Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough.
Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</desc>

You are an explorer on assignment in a remote corner of the universe. You have just been reassigned to fight Krohn since your ship, the Millennium Orb, is the only space craft cabable of withstanding Krohn's black hole. To defeat Krohn, you must get past 30 different chambers blocking the path. On the left and right side of each chamber are force fields which you must maneuver to keep the Millennium orb within the chamber. Each chamber contains a plane in the center with various targets, around which the Orb will travel. You can make the Orb dive out of it's orbital path into the plane and hit the targets. To complete each chamber you need to complete a goal with the targets (often you will need to figure out a way to clear them all.) The Millenium Orb has a limited amount of feul, however, which will be used up over time and in even greater quantities should you miss the Orb with the force fields. When fuel is low, you can head to Vern's Orb-O-Rama and use earned credits to refuel your Orb. 

Included with the game is a pair of 3-D glasses which can give the game a more 3 dimensional appearance, though they aren't required for gameplay.</desc>

Your planet being attacked by an invading alien armada tends to change that sort of thing, though. The young princess of the invading army, Kahm, comes to Earth to take part in the annihilation of the human race. She ends up stranded on Earth, where Tetsuya finds her, and they fall for each other.

They decide that if they were to get married, the two planets would no longer be able to fight, and so they set off for Kahm's home planet to seek permission from her father, the emperor. Having been the one who ordered the invasion in the first place, though, he is not particularly pleased with this turn of events. Tetsuya is imprisoned, and Kahm is taken away to places unknown. Now, Tetsuya must break out of prison and rescue Kahm!

Outlanders is an action RPG based on the manga by Joji Manabe. Tetsuya, being just a regular guy, isn't a particularly able fighter, and at first is only equipped with a sword, though he can eventually find other weapons including a gun. At the beginning, Tetsuya's only companion is the brown, cloaked alien Nao, who helps him escape the holding cell, but eventually he will find others who will help him. Other standard RPG features are also present: items can be found and stored, and some characters can learn magic. The game uses a password system to save progress.</desc>

When they steal a spaceship and start to expand their wars across the solar systems, you are trained by the elders to halt their dominance and destroy the home planet with a secret weapon known as "Thunderbolt".

Using the typical thrust movement from the Asteroids games, you roam space with your starship to return the peace by force. Starting as a rookie, many enemy ships need to be destroyed to earn credits that can be exchanged for fuel, armor, weapons, shields and warp drives. The commander instructs you with specific missions, such as destroying outposts or freeing alien groups. However, your ultimate goal is to find the Toson Drive, the only device powerful enough to reach P'radikus. To spice things up, there are many weapons such as shock waves, mines, missiles, cloaking devices and atomic cannons. As your fuel constantly depletes, you often need to orbit new planets to refuel and stock weapons.</desc>

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<desc>Like the original Pac-Man, the basic game play of Pac-Man Championship Edition consists entirely of navigating Pac-Man through a maze, eating dots, power pellets and bonus items (such as fruits, keys, and other objects), and avoiding the four ghosts that roam the maze as well. If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, the player loses a life. Eating a power pellet causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them and send them back to their home, where they re-emerge in their original form.
However, there are several major differences from its original counterpart, making Pac-Man C.E. a faster paced game. Each maze is divided into two halves. Eating all the dots on one half causes a bonus item to appear on the other side, and eating the item causes a new maze to appear on the other half. Players can also collect additional power pellets to increase their powered up time and continue earning maximum points for eating ghosts.</desc>

		<name>Pachicom</name>
		<desc>Pachicom is a pachinko game simulation. Pachinko can be described as a game that is a cross between pinball and a slot machine. This game comes with two different game modes to play. Game A lets the player play until they attain a score of at least 3000. The goal is to achieve this score as fast they possibly can. Though, the game can still end prematurely by running out of balls to shoot. Game B lets the player try to get as high of a score as possible, but with an added time limit.
The game contains over 200 different board layouts to choose from. At the main menu, just choosing Game A or B will randomly assign a board for the player to play on, while choosing Select A or B will let the player select their own board of choice to play on.
The gameplay is mainly passive. Players can only adjust the shooting pressure knob which effects the speed and location of where the balls will land.</desc>

		<desc>The goal of Palamedes is to clear the screen which is, line by line, filling up with dice. Players control a small person situated near the bottom of the screen, who can only be moved to the left or right. The number of the dice the person is holding can be changed with the B button, pressing the A button will shoot the dice upwards. If the die hits another one with a matching number, the targeted dice disappears from the playing area and is added to a column at the bottom of the screen. Pressing down after lining up at least three dice of either the same number or consecutive numbers in the bottom row will destroy up to five lines at once.

There are three modes of play: The standard single player mode, which requires the player to destroy a set number of lines in order to advance to the next stage; a tournament mode in which the player has to duel a number of CPU-controlled opponents and a two player mode.</desc>

		<name>Palamedes 2 - Star Twinkles</name>
		<desc>Palamedes II can be described as "its predecessor, turned upside down". As before, your goal is to rearrange a set of dice and put them in a row for elimination. Only series of dice such as 4-4-4-4-4 or 1-2-3-4-5 can be eliminated, and depending on the series, this will result in one or several rows of dice to be eliminated from the screen. Unlike the original Palamedes, this time your character stands on top of the dice, and the growing pile of dice will crush him unless he makes the correct combinations to eliminate the pile. It's a bit like Tetris, and a bit like Klax.

Two modes are available: Mode 1 puts your player on top of a growing pile which must be eliminated. It can be played alone (single), against another human (match) or in a quest against the computer. 

Mode 2 puts your player on an already well-stocked pile, but unlike mode 1, the stacks can't be rearranged in order to reach the desired dice, so you have to make do with what is in the top layer to match whatever dice is shown on top of the playfield. An opposing player does the same, and the first one to reach the bottom wins. If both players run out of matching dice, a countdown begins to reveal a new dice, and it's necessary to react quickly to find the matching one in your pile. Due to the nature of mode 2, it can't be played alone, only in match or quest mode.</desc>

The game contains 6 stages, each in a separate location in the restaurant, such as the kitchen, freezer and basement. At the end of each level you are faced with a boss. In between each level is a bonus game where you play a slot machine to try and win some extra health and lives.</desc>

The castle itself consists of a total of twenty worlds consisting of five stages apiece, each of which is filled to the brim with enemies. From your overhead view, you must use your directional pad to move your character around the grid and push the onscreen obstacles into your enemies to destroy them for the keys to escape as well as other goodies (extra time, bonus points, etc.), but keep in mind that you'll need to use those same obstacles to construct a path to the exit. And don't forget to work fast either, as you only have 100 seconds to clear each puzzle. Fail and you'll lose a life (you start with only three).

This game may be played with either one or two players (simultaneous play). Player One controls the boy. Player Two gets to be the girl. Both must have their wits about them to make it past the hoards of springs, crazy rollers, witches, zombies, and more to make it home in one piece.</desc>

The game seems to take place in the future, with lanes restocking pins with lasers and certain characters dressed in strange, futuristic (or at least an 80s interpretation of futuristic) fashions. This is a complete departure from its box art, which seems more reminiscent of the 1950s and 60s.

The game allows for a lot of precision-based options in order to bowl effectively. This includes rotating the ball to put spin on it, selecting the power and hitting the power gauge just right. The player can also select which hand they favor and the weight of the ball during the character creation process.</desc>

And then, he meets a fellow sculptor, Akanemaru, who once was attacked by him, and the two engage in encounters with a phoenix, who, it is said, will grant to those who drink its blood eternal life - and the rest is history.</desc>

		<name>Pictionary : The Game of Video Quick Draw</name>
		<desc>Based on the board game, the object is to guess either a word or phrase based on a drawing. Each team starts on the same square on the board and the first team attempts to draw a picture based on a clue.  If his team correctly guesses the clue, then this team gets to roll the dice and advance along the board.  If the team fails to guess correctly, then the other team gets a chance to draw and guess. The game plays much in this way until a team reaches the final square on the board and successfully guesses the clue to win the game.

This game contains three different modes; regular game, alternative game, and drawing practice. It also allows for up to four teams which can be made comprising of any number of players per each team. 

In the regular game, a team will be given a turn to start revealing pieces of one of the 500+ drawings that are hidden in the game. Each drawing is a 6x8 size and has 48 pieces to it. To reveal the pieces, the player is made to play one of four timed minigames which are chosen depending on the color of the square the player landed on the board. The minigames consist of Attack of the Paint Zombies, The WareHouse Shuffle, Leapin' Energy Capsules!, and Four Alarm Rescue. In Attack of the Paint Zombies the player fires downwards at the aliens and the more aliens that are hit the more pieces that are revealed of the drawing. If the aliens hit the player, the player loses time off the clock. In The WareHouse Shuffle, the player goes all the way to the left side and then stacks as many boxes on top of each other that they can bring over all the way to the right side. While transporting the boxes, their are two enemies who can hit into your boxes thus subtracting them from the haul and also taking time away. Each box brought over reduces a piece of the hidden drawing. In  Leapin' Energy Capsules!, the player is an astronaut and is moving and jumping to collect blue spheres. While collecting the spheres the player must try to avoid hitting any enemies which will reduce time. Each sphere collected clears up another piece of the drawing. In Four Alarm Rescue, the player controls a pair of firemen on the ground with a net who are moving back and forth catching the jumping people above on the net. Each person rescued leads a revealed piece of the drawing while each person not rescued leads to reduced time.

The alternative game allows the player to draw the picture for other players to guess, so their are no minigames in this mode. Other than that, it is the same as the regular mode.

Drawing practice lets the player practice their drawing technique without the pressure of a timer.</desc>

The RPG-mode has six, multi-screen pinball tables, where you use your flippers to knock the pinball into enemies, find keys, and eventually rescue Princess Bali.  The other modes, POP!POP!, Viva Golf, and Circus, are each specialized multi-screen pinball tables involving sports, golf, and the circus.  The latter has a slot machine and a bonus game in which you throw balls at animals to save the girl they are chasing.</desc>

		<name>Pipe Dream</name>
		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

		<desc>A totally radical game entrenched in a deep underground maze of never-ending pipes. Here is your big chance to try out those plumbing skills. The water is on, think ahead, and most of all, keep on your toes. Nasty accidents do happen! The general idea is to keep the water flow happening by adding the most appropriate piece of pipe. Well, it sounds easy enough, but the pace gets pretty hectic as the water stream picks up momentum. You may want to use a cross pipe, straight pipe, points pipe or try connecting a storage tank along the way to slow things down while you try and catch your breath. Don't relax for too long or the only breath you'll be catching is underwater. The minute you thought you were done with this floor, here comes the next floor, just a little faster. Watch out... a totally addictive game!</desc>

That's why plundering and pillaging are back in style, as you command the role of a high seas high-jacker. Either an English Buccaneer, Dutch Adventurer, Spanish Renegade or French Explorer, each with a different skill level and strategic impact.
As a swashbuckling scoundrel, you'll barter with enemy merchants, trade for hidden treasure maps, negotiate with unscrupulous governors and forge alliances with monarchs who'd just as soon stab you in the back than float you a loan for new ships. Buth that's only half the battle! You'll also assault towns, sword fight with garrison commanders, lay siege to forts, and fire your cannons broadside at an armada of naval foes, including Spanish War Galleons, Dutch Frigates, French Merchantment and English Sloops.</desc>

It's a beautiful diamond ring, and it's impossible to resist! Unfortunately, it costs $10,000 - way beyond his budget. And to make matters worse, another man named Nick has eyes for Betty. Now our hero will have to work extra, EXTRA hard to buy it and impress Betty!

In Pizza Pop!, the player fights through seven crazy neighborhoods populated by a whole host of pizza-hungry characters. The player can, however, defeat his enemies by jumping on them, or whacking them with his pizza pan. The player can also run through the level or use motor vehicles to get around, but he can't run for too long or else he'll get tired - unless he jumps while running. In addition, there are two pizza-stacking mini-games which can earn the player points and extra lives.</desc>

		<desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.

The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.

After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.

Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.</desc>

		<desc>Pocket Zaurus: Ju Ouken no Nazo (possibly translated as "Pocket Zaurus: Mystery of Ten Kings Swords", the Ten Kings are the ten judges of hell who review the conduct of the recently deceased) is an action game developed by Bandai and published in February 1987. At the time of this game's release, Bandai produced a line of dinosaur pens, stationary, and similarly theme school supplied under the label Pocket Zaurus. As such, the game itself has a slight educational aspect to it.
The game is a horizontally scrolling action game. You control Hashimoto-Zaurus, named after Hashimoto, an employee of Bandai who presumably invented the concept of Pocket Zaurus. Despite sharing the name with the product line, characters which resemble those used in the product are hardly ever seen, and the enemies are not at all related either. The idea for the game was submitted by a reader of the game magazine "Family computer Magazine," which was published by Tokuma Shoten.</desc>

		<desc>Popeye no Eigo Asobi (Popeye's English Game) is the Japanese-exclusive spin-off to the Popeye arcade game.
The game includes three modes: Word Puzzle A, Word Puzzle B, and Word Catcher.[3] In Word Puzzle A (based on the first level of the original game), the player is given the Japanese term for a word in one of six categories: Animal, Country, Food, Sports, Science, and Others (due to technical limitations, these terms are displayed entirely as katakana, regardless of their origin).[3] Blank squares for the English word are given, and the player must maneuver Popeye around to point to letters of the alphabet in order to fill in the blanks. Each wrong letter entry prompts Brutus/Bluto to punch a basket carrying Swee'Pea; the player must solve the puzzle before Swee'Pea's basket is knocked off the platform it is attached to.
The player may also forfeit the puzzle by punching the "?" icon. If the puzzle is lost or forfeited, the correct English word will be displayed. Word Puzzle B is identical to the "A" mode; however, the player is not given the Japanese term beforehand. In the two-player Word Catcher mode (based on the third level of the original game), the first player controls Popeye and the second controls Bluto. Three Japanese words are displayed on the screen's left side, and both players compete to collect letters thrown by Olive Oyl to spell out their English equivalents. A player wins when he or she has correctly spelled five words.</desc>

		<desc>It is the year 2191, and Earth's blissful existence was governed by a master computer. Then suddenly, its master control program malfunctioned, and people panicked ensuring total chaos. Secret Agent Nova is called in to locate agents located in six sectors. These agents hold an ID card which Nova must acquire to gain access to the security room within each sector. There, he must defeat the guards and obtain secret tape units, and if Nova obtains six of these, he will be able to gain entry to the control center and defeat the guard to destroy the computer and restore order to society.

Power Blade is a platform game, in which you must run through the level, destroying various enemies, and exit through the door. However, you can't leave each sector without locating agents.  By destroy enemies, you can get power-ups which restore your energy or upgrade your weapon. Occasionally, you can get a special power-up which transforms you into a Mech, which has a special attack mode and an three units of energy.

You must get through each sector before time runs out. You can leave a sector without getting the ID card and go to another sector, and come back when you're ready.

		<desc>Christmas Eve, 2200.

The Delta Foundation has just finished the development of a cyborg unit which represents a new generation of fighting robots. They want to sell it to the government's department of defense as it would pose a threat to the security of the nation if it is sold to a foreign country. They have asked the president, who is actually an alien from outer space, to consider their offer and respond in one week. The government takes this matter very seriously, and assigns Nova to destroy the Delta Foundation. Unfortunately, the government cannot be involved in the event that something might happen to him.

Power Blade 2 has six stages which involves you running through the level, while killing off enemies and avoiding hazards. At the start, you can choose which stage to start at, but unlike Power Blade, once you have chosen a stage, you can't exit and choose another one until you have completed the current one first. Nearly each stage involves you using your wits, as you dodge spikes, jumping towards the top of the screen to avoid fire, and getting fans to lift you onto platforms. You can also slide your way through tight spots, as long as you slide in the right place.

At the end of each stage, you fight a different boss. However, in the end, you must fight all the bosses you fought before before you get to fight the alien leader.

It's a traditional baseball game that allows one human player against the CPU, two competing human players, or two competing CPU players in a 'Watch' spectator mode. Instead of being a full sequel to Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium the game is instead an updated version of the original. It adds a few features such as two additional teams (for a total of 12) and updates the official team rosters, but nothing changed in regards of gameplay, graphics or music. This is historically relevant as it would become common practice for future sports game franchises worldwide. This game is unrelated to R.B.I. Baseball 2 from Tengen. Although the original R.B.I. Baseball was ported from Family Stadium, both franchises diverged after the initial game. The R.B.I. Baseball series went on to favor a more realistic looking athlete sprites while the Family Stadium series continued with the cartoonish 'super deformed' sprites.</desc>

		<name>Pro Yakyuu : Family Stadium '88</name>
		<desc>Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88 is the third in Namco's Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium series. As with its immediate predecessor, Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '87, it is a slightly revamped version of the original with updated rosters. As with modern-day practice, Namco released these games annually with little to distinguish each new iteration. Unlike the previous versions there are now four stadiums to choose from. In addition to the size of the stadium, the presence of wind and the turf available in the stadium affect elements of the game. The concept of 'strong players' was also introduced in this version. Two players in the starting line-up are chosen at random to have their stats increased higher than usual. During the seventh inning, the 'Lucky 7' effect occurs, and all players receive enhanced status. The team edit function appears for the first time in this game (edited teams would disappear when the console power was turned off since no battery backup was included). Though this is the second sequel to Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, which was released in the US by Tengen as R.B.I. Baseball, Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88 is not to be confused with R.B.I. Baseball 3. Though the first R.B.I. Baseball was a direct localization, subsequent R.B.I. Baseball games were created in the US and are entirely independent from Namco's Family Stadium series.</desc>

Now, he's coming back stronger than ever, with a sinister plan that includes having his intergalactic warriors seep into the brains of the U.S. Army. To support his disguised forces of doom, he's recruited Jagger Froid, a demented alien from the Black Hole Galaxy. He's also shuttled in The Babula Destructoid Mechanism with its Beam of Death. With torrential terror about to rain down upon civilization, Earth's only hope rests with you, Scorpion, and your pal, the Dogster.

		<name>Punch-Out!!</name>
		<desc>"Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream" is the reedition of the previous version "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!". Contrary to popular belief, Tyson was not removed because of his rape conviction (which did not occur until a year after the changeover), but because his contract expired. Since he had lost the title to James "Buster" Douglas by that point, Nintendo made no attempt to negotiate a new contract with him. Tyson was however, slated to appear in a sequel of his own (Power Punch II) where he would be the protagonist, but as a result of his imprisonment, Nintendo lost interest and instead used a generic boxer named Mark Tyler.
Due to Mr. Dream being a simple head-swap and recolor of Mike Tyson, Mr. Dream fights in exactly the same manner as Mike Tyson in "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!" but has a better fighting record. For the first 90 seconds of the first round, Mr. Dream can floor Mac with one uppercut. The player can block these punches to reduce the impact, but it isn't recommended, as they l end up with little health left after that. While Mr. Dream can't use "flooring punches" forever, his punches are quick, his reaction time is top-notch, and he's also a difficult opponent to fight. The pass code to fight him is 007 373 5963.

Aside from being one of the few NES rail shooters, the game features an uncommon amount of destructible items in its levels. You also have the ability to move Frank to the left or right of the screen to dodge incoming fire, or to hold down the fire button to lock him in place and move the aiming cursor.

The game features six "missions" with a number of varying environments and levels within them. Standard pickups of armor and increased firepower are present, as well as grenades which can be launched with the B button. Earning a 100% kill rating (as The Punisher would surely try to do) gives an unlimited "Super Gun" upgrade for the next stage.</desc>

		<desc>Nagagutsu o Haita Neko: Sekai Issh 80 Nichi Dai Boken (lit. "Puss in Boots: An Adventure Around the World in 80 Days") is a video game based on the third film of The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots that was released exclusively in Japan for the Family Computer. Four years later, the game (with several modifications) was released in North America under the title Puss 'n Boots: Pero's Great Adventure.
Pero has to either avoid or eliminate this cat-like enemies who stands in his way. The main character is the Puss in Boots character from the tale; a cat named Pero (Toei Animation's mascot) He is also known as 'Perrault' in the game, as that was the name of the original author of the Puss In Boots story; Charles Perrault. He is known for helping an impoverished master attain wealth through the use of trickery.
Loosely based on Jules Verne's classic novel Around the World in Eighty Days tied together with a classic anime, the player has 80 days in order to travel the world; this is shown through a time limit. One day passes in the game approximately every minute, although certain items can subtract the number of remaining days, providing the player with less time to complete the game. If these 80 days elapse before the player finishes the trip, the game is over no matter how many lives the player has remaining. Places that are explored include: England, the Atlantic Ocean, Arabia, Hong Kong, the Pacific Ocean, Alaska, the North Pole, and Big Ben. The game features "death water," a video game feature where video game characters instantly die after coming into contact with a watery substance.
This game also involves driving boats, cars, and balloons in addition to the standard walking through the stages.</desc>

Blocks fall in pairs and can be rotated with the A button (similar to Puyo Puyo), and a line of 3 or more matching blocks in any direction will vanish (similar to Columns). The unique element is that the falling blocks cycle through every picture, stopping when the block lands or the player presses the B button. Points are awarded based on which picture is matched (7 and BAR are worth much more), the number of blocks in a cleared line, and for chain combos. Each level has a score goal that the player must clear before the block counter reaches 0.</desc>

Slide the pieces into the open spaces to rearrange them back into the proper order. If you're stuck, you have the option of challenging the computer to a game of chance like rock, paper, scissors or roll the dice. This will subtract 60 seconds from your time, but if won allows any two pieces on the board to be swapped. If you forget what the picture looks like, you can pause the game and see the completed version, but this can only be done five times per puzzle. There are eight different levels, plus two additional expert levels.</desc>

		<name>Puzznic</name>
		<desc>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</desc>

Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls.

While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced "kicks"), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing.

1. C.J.'s Elephant Antics: C.J. the elephant went and got himself caught in an elephant trap. One thing led to another and the next thing you know, he's in a Parisian zoo. He makes a break for it and vows to make his way back home to Africa, traveling through Paris, Switzerland, and Egypt in order to reach his destination. This game is a side-scrolling action game. Offensively, C.J. can toss bombs at myriad enemies in his path. He also has a parachute that allows him to glide safely down from great heights. 2 players can play this game cooperatively as 2 differently colored C.J. characters.

2. Stunt Buggies: this game involves 1 or 2 players piloting buggies around dangerous mazes filled with renegade buggies on a quest to collect all the bombs in order to escape the maze.

3. F-16 Renegade: your crazy professor has hacked into the US Air Force's computers and programmed all of the jets to fly off and start World War III. Since no one will believe your tale on this matter, you take it upon yourself to follow your professor's footsteps: you hack into the USAF computers yourself but to locate the F-16 training program so that you can then break into the air base and heist a jet in order to take down all of the malevolent computer-controlled jets. The action in this game consists of flying a jet and shooting other jets. However, the perspective alternates from overhead scrolling (odd levels) to 3rd person view from behind the jet (even levels). Powerups come in the form of stronger weapons, smart bombs, and extra lives. The game also features a 2-player competitive mode.

4. Go! Dizzy Go!: Dizzy's nemesis, the evil wizard Zaks, has abducted Dizzy's friends. Thus, the task falls to Dizzy to rescue them. To do this, he must collect fruit in a variety of dangerous mazes scattered throughout several worlds including an underwater realm, forest realm, a pyramid, a mountain, and a castle. Additionally, 2 players can team up to conquer the mazes.

All of the games feature 2-player modes. This is an unlicensed NES game.</desc>

The player controls Ki in her way up the 60 tower's levels. As in the original game, she must find the key to exit each floor of the tower in a limited time. But unlike the original, this game is a platformer, and the player controls an unarmed Ki who must avoid the tower's mosters. To make her way up, she can dash and jump, and she'll keep getting higher as long as the jump button is held. If she hits a ceiling when jumping or a wall when dashing, she'll drop to the ground and be stunned by a moment.

Ki will also find chests with items to help her (like warps to higher levels of the tower or wings that will help her control her "floating), which effects will last only until she leaves the floor where she found them.</desc>

The game features One Player and Two Player options as well as a Password mode to enable you to play a full season (one game against every team in the division). In addition, a watch mode provides you with the best seat in the house for a computer-controlled match up.

This second version is similar to the original game in terms of gameplay. This time around the game uses the teams and statistics from the 1989 season. Just as in the original, you get to see what it's like to step up to the plate as Ricky Henderson, pitch the ball like Nolan Ryan, and catch a line drive like Ozzie Smith.</desc>

		<desc>R.B.I. Baseball 3 took the popular baseball series a step further statistically, adding each Major League Baseball division winning team from 1983-1990, in addition to the 1989 All Star teams and all 26 1990 teams (with full 1989 statistics). Want to see how the 1986 Mets might have done against the 1987 Twins? Here's your chance.

The game was licensed by the Major League Baseball Players' Association; thus, real Major League players and statistics are included, but the teams themselves are represented only by their home cities. Team names are not used. Also, retired players who were no longer under contract with the MLBPA in 1991 are not present. Rather, they are represented by their initials and their fielding positions.

Game mechanics remain unchanged from R.B.I. Baseball 2, focusing more on arcade fun than realistic gameplay.</desc>

Once again, you have to bring your red radio-controlled car to victory, score points, hit turbo speed lines, and leave no chance to your blue, green, and yellow adversaries. But you can also upgrade your engine and tires - if you can afford it, which means you'll have to think seriously about gathering those dollar signs scattered on the track. The tracks themselves have more variety, some have unusual enemies (little planes bombing you from above), and more kinds of obstacles. You also have several lives and don't die immediately if you arrived last.</desc>

As a specially-ordered game from Computrainer, it was used to help increase bikers' performance for marathons and races. It came in an oversized Computrainer shipping box and typically included a top loader NES, multiple manuals (all different), Racermate Challenge II cart, and several accessories in which you used to hook your bike up to the NES. The game would keep track of your speed and endurance and let you know how well you were doing. A rather odd game and extremely tough to find anywhere especially complete since many would have thrown the box and manuals away.</desc>

The player controls a motorcycle and must cross the finish line before an established number of competitor bikes. The player must avoid crashing into obstacles, opposing racers, vehicles, and running out of gas. During a race there are certain areas where the player can refill their gas but stopping to refuel will cause competitor bikes to take advantage and race past the player. Competitors never run out of fuel but they are able to crash into obstacles thus taking them out of the race.

Occasionally during a race a helicopter will fly by dropping items that the player is able to pick up. The items are a 1000 Points Bonus, helper motorcycles that help you crash other racers, extra gasoline, Hi-grade gasoline which lasts longer than normal, a   turbocharger that gives extra speed, and a helmet which provides  invincibility.

If the player places in the top ten in a race, they are able to tune up their bike with better equipment. The player can upgrade their bike's engine (either 2 cycle type or 4 cycle type) and its tires(either rain, brock, or stick).</desc>

There are two rounds of gameplay followed by a third "think real fast" round. 

In the first two rounds of gameplay the gameboard consists of a giant TV with nine channels; one of the players chooses a channel (representing a particular category) revealing a question; the first player to buzz in and provide the correct answer earns points. The are a variety of categories available (some of these are "video high", "cop shows", "saturday night live", "soap operas", and many more) which will vary from game to game. Sometimes a surprise channel may appear which doesn't have a question, but awards or removes points from a player. These rounds end when all of the supplied questions have been exhausted. Near the end of the second round, the lowest scoring player is eliminated from the game leaving two players for the final round.

The final "think real fast" round lasts for thirty seconds; during this time the players need to answer as many short answer questions as possible to earn points. At the end of this round the player with the most points wins the game.</desc>

You play the Road Runner. You must run along the road, avoiding trucks, landmines, falling rocks, etc. and also not get caught by Wile E. Coyote. You must also eat birdseed along the way or you will become faint and Wile E. will catch you.

You can get points for eating birdseed and making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc.

The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions are one player only. The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points. This may have been due to programming constraints on the Atari 2600.</desc>

Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane will fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.</desc>

		<desc>In a desperate measure to combat the overpopulation of Earth, scientists work to create an artificial planet named Altile, named after the scientist who designed it. During the construction of Altile, humanity has become united and peaceful. During this new era of prosperity, Earth decommissions the RoboWarriors, a force of heavily armed half-man half-robot war vehicles. But from another dimension, aliens calling themselves the Xantho Empire and lead by the being Xur invade planet Altile and terraform it for their own uses. The survivors of Altile send out a distress call to Earth. Receiving this message, the people of Earth quickly activate the latest and most powerful of the RoboWarriors, a model known as ZED (Z-Type Earth Defense) and send it at top speed to Altile.

Controlling ZED from an overhead view, the player is able to move in any of 4 directions (up,down,left,right), drop bombs and shoot a projectile weapon. The terrain of Altile is made up of many obstacles and the bombs serve to destroy these and make passage for ZED. Destroying any enemy or obstacle may yield different power-ups which contain any of 10 different effects (including ammunition and energy refills) which may be stocked and used at any time from the menu. Or the power-ups may be instant-use refills for bombs and energy supplies.

Additionally some levels contain keys, which unlock doors and Chalices which prevent the level from running on endlessly. Secret areas such as a Well of Hope and a Room of Idols may also be found. Altogether, there are eight different "worlds" for ZED to conquer, containing numerous stages and guarded by a vicious boss monster.</desc>

The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.</desc>

However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. Thus, you are sent back in time to change the result of the war using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.

The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.</desc>

It is up to the hero to don the jet pack and the helmet to stop the Nazis and keep the world safe.

The Rocketeer is a side-scrolling, run-and-jump (and sometimes fly) game. About halfway through the first stage, the Rocketeer is able to scavenge jet fuel power-ups, in addition to health and ammo power-ups. The fuel power-ups allow him to use his namesake power and fly for short distances. The Rocketeer has 6 offensive options available from the start of the game, limited only by the amount of ammunition points he has in reserve: A punch (requires no ammo points and is therefore unlimited), pistol (1 ammo point per fire), tommygun (2 ammo points), spread gun (3 ammo points), grenade (5 ammo points), and a bazooka (20 ammo points).</desc>

Through the channels Willy it will be sent to different themed shows such as western movies, gangster movies, etc, as well as some bonus channels.

Willy can walk and jump around, and carries as a weapon a spring-load Super Punch Gun, which he can put in diverse uses:

1. Knock his enemies: by pressing A.
Perform higher jumps: by jumping (B) and pressing down + A.
Spin Attack: by grabbing a ledge (A) and rotating with the d-pad.
Spin Jump: by grabbing a ledge (A), rotating with the d-pad and jumping (B).
Catch and Trow: by holding A, grabbing an object and releasing A.

He can also buy attachments that will make his gun more powerful, such as the Bomber, the Twin Balls, the Hammer Punch and the Jet Sneakers.

While the game does not come with the license of Major League Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics. Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C. Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox. 

The gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.

A player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice.</desc>

It includes a silly story about three different roller skates gangs (somewhat like motor cycle gangs) in a close future, which is most an excuse for the game to exist.

You can choose between three different gangs, one is all-around, one is fast and weak (and consists of women) and one is slow and strong, you get the fashion. This adds some replayability, but in reality, they are kind of the same.

The game also suffers from trial and error; you must learn the courses if you want to master them. Luckily, the game has unlimited continues.</desc>

		<desc>Another game based on the animé series Saint Seiya. The animé (and the game) tells the story of the noble Bronze Saints who have to save the goddess Athena, the only benevolent deity among the rivaling Greek gods. In the game, you control four Bronze Saints: Pegasus Seiya, Cygnus Hyoga, Dragon Shiryu, and Andromedus Shun. At specific parts of the game, you'll have to choose a specific character in order to trigger a story-related event.

The gameplay is split into side-scrolling action and RPG-like turn-based fights. During the side-view sequences you travel through short levels, beating up goons who are trying to stop you, jumping and trying not to fall into the abyss. You accumulate experience points, called "Seven Senses", which you can then distribute to raise your HP or Cosmo Power. Cosmo is a kind of energy you need to perform an attack, and it decreases the more you fight. In the end of a level, a boss usually awaits you, whom you fight in turn-based style, performing punches and kicks.</desc>

		<desc>Edoropolis is home to a race of Animaloids, anthropomorphic animals which are a combination of flesh and cybernetic body parts. They are ruled by Shogun Tokugawa Lei Lei and his daughter, Tokugawa Usako. Unfortunately for them, the Prime Minister Kitsunezuka Ko'on No Kami is actively trying to depose both of them and wants to assume power by force! He's always got a plan up his sleeves, usually involving attacking the city using an army of Ninja Crows, led by Karamaru and Karasu Gennarisai (who also serves as Ko'on No Kami's advisor).

It's here where Inuyama Wanko-no-Kami, Chief of the Palace guard, steps in - by bringing in the Secret Ninja Team Nyankii! Whenever Wanko-No-Kami hears that Ko'on No Kami is plotting something, he dispatches the Nyankiis from their secret base at the Pizza Cat Restaurant so they can stop him before he is successful.

However, there are rumors that a foreign scientist called Dr. Purple is aiding Ko'on No Kami... but for what purpose? What could Ko'on No Kami be planning this time?

Kyatto Ninden Teyandee is a side-scrolling action game in the tradition of Ninja Gaiden, and it is based off the Japanese TV show produced in 1990 by Tatsunoko Productions and Sotsu agency. There are eleven stages in total, and you can play as any of the three main Secret Ninja Team Nyankii members: Yattaro, leader of the team, who uses his Cat's Eye Sword as his main weapon; Pururun, the only female on the team, who attacks with projectiles and her razor-sharp nails; and Sukashii, who uses an umbrella to dispatch his enemies.

By pausing the game, you can switch out and change places with one of the four Rescue Team members in order to use their special abilities: Rikinoshin can break boulders, Mietoru can fly for a limited time, Gotton can drill through certain walls, and Nekkii can swim easily and use water attacks. You can only use their abilities for a limited amount of time, which can be recovered by picking up items with a cat paw printed on it.

All seven playable characters have an upgradable special move, which can be used by pressing Up + B. Each move is more devastating than the last, but can only be used a certain amount of times, until the Ninpo bar is drained.</desc>

		<name>Sanada Juu Yuushi</name>
		<desc>It is a Sengoku era themed RPG featuring ninjas. Sanada Yukimura (also known as Sanada Nobushige) is the titular character. He was a Japanese samurai warrior of the Sengoku period. He was especially known as the leading general on the losing side of the Siege of Osaka. Yukimura was called "A Hero who may appear once in a hundred years" and "Crimson Demon of War". A legend says that Yukimura had ten heroes who took an active role at the battles of Osaka Castle. They were called the Sanada Ten Braves, the group of ninjas who are also referenced by the title.
In the game, Sanada must locate and recruit the ten braves. Upon finding each one, they usually require that Sanada complete a task before they agree to join him. Combat is conducted in turns, using typical menu commands. However, unlike the Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy series, which popularized party-on-party battles, combat in this game is strictly one-on-one. However, the player may select from among any recruited character to do battle, even changing characters between rounds. The game was never released outside of Japan, nor translated from the original Japanese. A remake was developed for mobile phones and published in 2005.</desc>

		<desc>Sangokushi refers to a novel written about the Three Kingdoms period of China, where the country was temporarily split into three warring states. This is different to the the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel, a mostly fictionalized account written some considerable time after the conflict was over and has had many video game adaptations, not least of which being Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms and their later Dynasty Warriors series.

As a war strategy game, the goal for the player and their chosen side is to reclaim all of China under their rule. Players can gather intel, invade other territories or increase their own stats and purchase weapons and supplies for their armies. The game affords the player a certain number of actions per turn before letting the CPU opponents have their turns.

Though this game was created after Romance of the Three Kingdoms, it is in fact the first NES game to be based on the conflict.</desc>

Many of the NPCs in game will tell you that Cows are sacred animals and a few will mention the Tower of Rta Satya. There is a set of armor in the game called Dharma Armor, which will prevent the player from dealing or being dealt damage.
The story revolves around a Boy/Girl that steals a treasured Ostrich egg from the village of Orissa and decides to reflect upon one's actions; aspiring to become a Dragoon to restore their lost honor. The protagonist will set out on an adventure saving lives, performing good deeds, and raising a newly hatched dragon. There are bosses and many NPC street vendors will attempt to scam you with defective items or attempt to mug you. While the main protagonist does not level and their base stats are fixed at 40 STR, 40 DEF. The dragon that you raise does level. More unique game mechanics to this game include the ability to feed dead bodies to your dragon to raise his level, enchanted armors, field map events, hidden landmarks, a few side quests, and mini-games.
Sansara Naga's gameplay and gameplay mechanics are similar to those of Dragon Quest I, Pokémon and Earthbound.
The Silver Mountains are also referred to as Heaven.</desc>

Like in many Famicom adventure games, the player can gather clues by examining sites of interest, talking to various people and keeping track of the information they've gathered. As the case continues, more people working for the titular game company start dying and the player is given more murders to solve. Time is an important factor in the game as talking to right people and being in the right places at the right moments will prove instrumental towards solving the mystery. The President of the game company only gives the protagonist three days to solve the case before they get the police involved, giving the player a strict deadline. The game's writer will introduce himself just before the player is asked to identify the culprit, and provide the game's final opportunity to save. The game also has multiple endings, depending on what the player does after the murderer has been identified.</desc>

The battle system is turn-based, the encounter rate in dungeons is very high, and the game moves at a fast pace with allies joining and leaving the party at various intervals. SD Blader is very
much like an early Dragon Quest RPG with nice sub stories involving each town, except that you use guns and science rather than swords and sorcery: and it's

The objective of the game is to conquer both Earth and space, by leading your army into battle against groups of rival armies. There are 10 preset scenarios in the game, each with a specified number of teams and a time limit to get the objectives done. (The player can also choose a Free Scenario.) Once a scenario is chosen, and game settings are set (all settings can be changed in Free Scenario mode), the player and computer take turns navigating units through a series of menus, in the hopes of gaining enough force to occupy a locale. Once a locale is captured, the player who took it over gains money which can be used to bolster their units. The first player to capture all 21 areas (or the player further ahead when time is up) wins the scenario. A battery-backed memory allows players to save their progress and return to the game at a later time.</desc>

However many Petra survivors were trapped on the surface of the planet. To that end, a rescue bike named the Gilgitt Petras was created. It must venture up to the surface and save as many Petras as possible.

Seicross is a side-scroller. Controlling the Gilgitt Petras, the player must race across the screen, collecting Petra survivors and fuel power-ups. The single weapon and ability available is the ability to fire straight ahead.</desc>

		<desc>Sesame Street: Big Bird's Hide and Speak is a game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was one of the simplest-to-play NES games ever released commercially. This game stars Big Bird and co-stars Little Bird, and features Bert, Ernie, The Count, Grover, and Elmo. This game was developed by RSP Inc. and published by Hi Tech Expressions. All 4 sides of the D-pad move little bird to the next window clockwise; A and B Buttons both choose a window. The center buttons (Start and Select) exit to the game select screen. The game's objective was to choose the correct character or letter, with six different levels. The first two levels are based on simply choosing the window instructed by Big Bird, while the next two needed memorizing since the windows close. In the fifth level the player had to spell the three-letter word instructed by choosing the right letters and the last level the player must attempt to spell the most number of different words before a time limit, the letters in the windows changing after a new word is created.</desc>

		<desc>Shadow Brain is a First Person RPG Dungeon Crawler title for the Nintendo Famicom that was only released in Japan back in May 3 1991 by Pony Canyon - who were also involved in games like Ultima I-IV and Super Pitfall. The game plays very similar to Shin Megami Tensei (NES) and is one of the few games of this genre to be available on this console.
Originally, Shadow Brain was sold with a VHS tape detailing the story behind the game. The game has a Sci-Fi story behind it, decent graphics and nice music. Shadow Brain seems like a very solid alternative to Shin Megami Tensei.</desc>

		<desc>In the 21st century, the evil Emperor Garuda has taken over the city of New York, killing many of its inhabitants. You play as either Hayate or Kaede, two ninjas who are attempting to free the city from Garuda's control.

Shadow of the Ninja is a typical side-scrolling action game, consisting of running, slashing and jumping through 5 levels, each with 4 sub-stages with numerous and varied foes, and a boss enemy at their end.

Kaede and Hayate can not only jump; as ninjas, they can hang from platforms and make swift saltomortals between floors. Sometimes, canisters containing powerups can be found. Typical powerups extend range of the default sword, or they may be additional weapons such as throwing stars and a ninja weapon that looks like a big grappling hook on a string.

The game allowed two players to play cooperatively, a rare feature for action games outside of the Contra series.

Players take the part of an adventurer sent to the ancient keep of Shadowgate on a quest to find a mystic artifact known as the Staff of Ages and stop the evil Warlock Lord from summoning a horrific demon known as the Behemoth. However Shadowgate has become infested with the Warlock Lord's demonic minions, not to mention the castle's still functional booby-traps.

Unlike Deja Vu, death comes at you suddenly, unexpectedly, and most of all OFTEN. Such simple acts as pulling the wrong switch or opening the wrong door can cause you to be skewered by a booby-trap or disemboweled by a monster. It's allso worth mentioning the fact that if your torch burns out (this happens quite regularly) and you forget to light a new one, you'll trip in the dark and break your neck.

A Windows 3.x update to this game was created in 1991.</desc>

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the center. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</desc>

		<desc>Shatterhand is an action game with eight-direction scrolling. You control Shatterhand in his quest to find and defeat General Grover, leader of the Metal Command. Through the game you’ll encounter all kinds of mechanical and biomechanical creatures. Shatterhand’s primary weapon is his cybernetic fists and therefore most enemies must be defeated by punching them.

Additional help can be given from any of the eight hovering satellite robots, each of which has it’s own weapon that fires automatically when Shatterhand throws a punch. These satellite robots can be obtained by collecting combinations of alpha-beta letters that appear when you punch some of the white boxes that are scattered throughout each stage.

The game has seven stages. The first and the last must be played first and last respectively, but the five middle stages can be played in any order. The path to the final showdown with General Grover leads through a factory, a refinery, an anti-gravity research facility, a submarine, a burning subway, a filtration plant and finally to General Grover’s missile launch complex.</desc>

		<name>Kaijuu Monogatari</name>
		<desc>Kaijuu Monogatari ("Shell Creature Story") is an 8-bit RPG for the NES that more than superficially resembles Enix's Dragon Quest. As with many RPG contemporaries for the system, it borrows the basic premise (talk to the King, discover what to do next, fight some evil force) and the turn-based tactical combat and gradual character development of its major influence, but also much of its aesthetic: The box art has some Akira Toriyama-inspired artwork and the protagonist wears a familiar suit of blue armor. Kaijuu Monogatari's subtitle - Shell Saurs Story - is a localization of its Japanese name.
The plot, in greater detail, concerns a race of peaceful shell creatures that have four elemental warriors that united to fight the villainous Fat Badger but were separated in the final struggle. The player needs to unite the four by exploring the world and discovering the locations of the other three warriors, then regrouping for another attack.
A unique twist, though one that would also become a feature in Dragon Quest IV (thus coming full circle innovation-wise), is that the player is able to assume any of one these four heroes at any point by selecting a menu option, though each one begins at level 1 and is very weak. In order for the party to be strong enough to meet up, each must be independently raised to a sufficiently high level.
The game would eventually spawn its own franchise with sequels and spin-offs being released for the Super Famicom and Game Boy in Japan.</desc>

By travelling all over Great Britain, he can collect the clues and defeat the thugs in order to conduct a thorough investigation.

Parks, sewers and even private houses provide clues needed to solve the mystery and bring the kidnapper to justice. Innocent citizens can also be kicked around just like the criminals. Knives and guns can also be integrated into Holmes' offensive techniques; allowing him to collect money from fallen thugs. If Holmes is killed by any means, the mystery becomes a perfect crime, thus terminating the game.</desc>

		  The goal of the game is to get the protagonist, who is a jiang shi by default, to the exit. To do this they must push mahjong tiles out of the way. Most mahjong tiles will disappear once they touch one or more of the same type, and these tiles will also vanish along with it. Some, like the dragon or wind tiles, are barricades that will transform any tile that comes into contact into another barricade.</desc>

Pro Yakyuu was skipped. What eventually became Bases Loaded 3 was instead the fourth Moero!! Pro Yakyuu game, Moero 8!! Pro Yakyuu '90 Kandouhen.

A curious addition to this version is that of the biorhythms, which tells the player how each athlete is feeling: If the athlete is having an off-game, one or more of these biorhythms will be low and the player will need to strategize around these dips. Though big in 70s sports punditry, the idea of mathematical biorhythms predicting an athlete's prowess in any upcoming game was all but discredited as pseudoscience by the time when this game came out.</desc>

		<desc>Shin Satomi Hakkenden: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai ("New Eight Dog Chronicles: Battle of Light and Darkness") is a traditional Japanese RPG that follows the story of the 19th century historical novel Nansou Satomi Hakkenden, or Eight Dog Chronicles, based on eight half-brother samurai who were all descended from a dog and team up for various adventures across Sengoku period Japan. In particular, the game is based on the 1983 live-action movie, localized in the west as Legend of the Eight Samurai which in turn was based on a 1982 reworking of the epic novel named Shin Satomi Hakkenden.

The game has a then-distinct feature of being able to start the game as any of the eight samurai, each of which begins the game in a different location. Their goal is to meet up and recruit their brothers, eventually forming a group of eight. The game is otherwise standard for the genre: the player splits their time between exploring towns and talking to NPCs, and fighting monsters and enemy soldiers in dungeons and the overworld map via a turn-based combat system.</desc>

		<desc>One of several Mahjong solitaire games released by Sachen. Mahjong Trap - Si Cuan Ma Que is based on the popular solitaire game Mahjong Tiles, a game adapted by Joseph Babcock to the United States around the end of the First World War. However, Mahjong did originate in China, but its adaptation in the 1920s spread like wildfire across Britain, the United States, and Australia, among other countries. Hacker International's version, Shisen Mahjong - Seifuku Hen, has added erotic themes. In the game the player(s) tackle six difficulty levels with three levels in each that reveal their own set of erotic images upon completion of each stage. The game's notable in that it features voice clips (although low quality) and is very difficult, partially due to the lackluster programming. There's a two-player mode in the game where if a connection isn't made in time, a sound clip will play and the other player will take control. This is probably the best way to tackle the game, considering how complex the puzzles get.</desc>

		<desc>In Shockwave you need to retrieve powerful crystals left behind by the Tarian race. The Rastons are after the crystals also, which places a short time limit on the mission. You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the maze and retrieve all of the crystals.</desc>

You can choose between different difficulty levels. They affect the time you have to complete the stages. For difficulty level 1 you get 300 game time, difficulty level 2 gives you 250 and the 3rd difficulty level only 200.
Items you can shoot during the game include an hourglass which        extends time by 50, an E which gives you 100 points + 1 Energy bar, an E in a white square which gives you 100 points + 2 Energy bars, a Reverse E which gives you 1 Energy bar and C or W symbol which both give only 100 points each. Each disc you shoot above an enemy is worth between 100-500 points.
The game contains three stages that involve a western, ghost house, and a space theme. There is also a bonus stage where you try to shoot as many bottles as possible. In the party game mode, you compete to have the highest score.</desc>

		<name>Shoukoushi Ceddie</name>
		<desc>Shoukoushi Cedie is the Japanese title of the 1886 Frances Hodgson Burnett novel Little Lord Fauntleroy, about a down-to-earth kid from New York discovering his heritage as the heir to an Earldom in England, moving to his inherited estate and learning how to become a nobleman. Fuji Television created a 43 episode anime series based on the novel in 1988, and this video game adaptation is based on that TV show. Fuji Television is perhaps best known in western video game circles for being responsible for Doki Doki Panic (the game the American/European Super Mario Bros 2 is based on) as well as airing GameCenter CX (or Retro Game Master). The game plays much like a regular Famicom adventure game: The player walks around, talks to people and finds items which are used to solve puzzles. However, rather than selecting destinations from a menu, the player manually walks around the different locales using a top-down perspective. There are also action sequences where the player must avoid random pedestrians when leaving the estate. If he collides with an NPC, or goes into the wrong door, he is chided by his tutor and forced to answer trivia questions.</desc>

You get a chance to match your skills at this Air Hockey style game, over 'Cantina Band' inspired music. Deflect the puck around the walled area using your bat, trying to knock it into your opponent's goal.

There are several competitors, from which some of them definitely cheat, so be prepared to be laughed at. However, you can cheat as well, as you can resize your stick to fill the whole table width, or add one in the middle, and see who breaks glass first. There are single plays or the tournament where you play opponents in order of difficulty. The winner is the one who reaches 15 glassbreaks first.</desc>

After each stage completed (and some luck), a bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to earn extra balls. You will only need a good target in the parquet block!</desc>

Take one of the "fleet boats" and go on extended patrols of up to 2 months from Hawaii, Australia, or New Zealand. Set your difficulty/realism level and time period (early means less tech for juicier targets, later means tougher escorts, more tech, lousier targets). Contend with factors like dud torpedoes, maximum depth, and more. 

You can choose among practice run against some old hulks, recreate historical convoy attacks, go on a single patrol, or go on your own campaign, which lets you go multiple patrols until you die, get promoted, or survive the war.

Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joined the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a "goose" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game (a "goose" could appear even during the end of level baddie!).</desc>

If you do like the Dragon Quest games, however, you get less grinding, some pretty nice music, pleasant graphics, and a new world to explore.</desc>

Silver Surfer learns that creatures from the Magick Dimension are trying to break through into the universe and their coming will end all life. Vowing to stop them, Silver Surfer must assemble the pieces of a mysterious Cosmic Device and use it to push them back. The pieces of the Device are currently in the hands of some malicious creatures: Reptyl, Mephisto, Skrull Emperor, Possessor and Firelord. Silver Surfer must travel to their domains and defeat them in order to obtain pieces of the device.

Silver Surfer is a shooter game, with some levels taking place vertically and some horizontally. The Surfer's only ability is to move around on the screen and to shoot directly in front of him. Power-ups that can be picked up include: the letter "F" (Firepower) which will increase the number and power of his projectiles, Smart bombs which destroy everything on the screen, the letter "S" (Speedup) which increases the surfer's movement and Orbs which will also fire the Surfer's weapon. Orbs are special in that two can be obtained (only 1 is shown on horizontal scrolling levels) and they can be positioned to fire forwards, backwards or sideways.</desc>

		<name>The Simpsons : Bart vs. the Space Mutants</name>
		<desc>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.

Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

He tells Bart he is the only one who can save Radioactive Man who has been sent to the Limbo Zone, a mysterious prison that revolves around a black hole. Bart turns into Bartman and he has to fight three super villains to collect Radioactive Man's lost powers before facing the mastermind Brain-O the Magnificent.

Players control Bartman through 2D side-scrolling platform levels. He needs to defeat enemies, collect goodies, and be careful not to fall into one of the deadly traps on his way. Bartman can punch and kick, and collect lightning icons to shoot small bolts. Most of the level sequences require precise timing and pixel-perfect jumping precision. Bartman has five life points that are restored by collecting radioactive signs.

		<desc>Skate or Die incorporates five distinct styles of skating, which can be attempted individually or in turn. You skate around a menu room to choose which one to attempt. Before taking off you can visit Rodney's skate shop to buy equipment.

The first event is freestyle, in which your aim is to score as many points as possible in 10 attempts. Judges determine how much style and skill you have shown. The High Jump uses the same equipment, only this time your task is to jump as high as possible at the end of the ramp.

The downhill events are overhead-view races. In the Downhill Race you simply try to complete the course within 90 seconds. In the Downhill Jam you try to outperform a human or computer opponent whilst dodging or jumping hazards. You can use attacking moves to either remove hazards or knock your opponent over. 

The pool joust is more of a one-on-one beat em up using a stick, set within a pit to skate around.</desc>

For huge points, pick up a bomb hidden in the level (you will be warned by a sound when approaching it) and drop it on a large structure. If you fail to land on the landing strip, you run out of fuel and crash.

You can only shoot horizontally and diagonally by tilting the plane's nose. When in trouble, perform an aerial loop with the secondary button, this often destroys other planes and avoids bullets. There is a co-op mode with the character Max as well.</desc>

The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</desc>

FOX-HOUND has gained intelligence that an unknown terrorist group has seized a remote facility containing mass-produced Metal Gear tanks, as well as a new Metal Gear prototype which was under development. The newly-promoted Lt. Solid Snake is called back into action to infiltrate the terrorists' base with the help of two FOX-HOUND rookies, former marine Nick Myer and navy intelligence agent John Turner.

The player once again assume the role of Snake. The objective is similar to the previous game, as the player must avoid any kind of visual contact (even moreso than the first game), while collecting weapons and equipment on-site. There is a greater variety of areas such as a jungle, a warehouse, a train, a couple of prisons and even a cargo ship containing the mass-produced Metal Gears. The player must also overcome new traps such as searchlights, soldiers in gyrocopters, door-sealing devices and even suicide bombers. The player must also interrogate captured enemy officers by injecting them with a truth serum to increase their rank, in addition to saving hostages like in the first game. Side-scrolling areas are also included in addition to the main overhead game, where the game takes a more action-oriented route (while still maintaining the stealth premise).</desc>

These can be rolled into  giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually  defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.

		<name>Solar Jetman : Hunt for the Golden Warpship</name>
		<desc>The golden warpship was once the most powerful ship in the galactic fleet. But the ship was captured by aliens, and its parts scattered throughout twelve different worlds. On each world deadly aliens, booby traps, black holes, and extreme gravitational forces guard the parts. It is now up to Solar Jetman to land on each of the worlds and retrieve all the parts so the golden warpship may be reassembled.

At the beginning of each world, Solar Jetman starts out at the mother ship and explores using a jetpod. When a part of the golden warpship or something else of use is located, the jetpod can be used to haul it back to the mother ship. The mother ship will move on to the next world when all the parts on the current world have been brought back. If the jetpod takes too much damage, Solar Jetman must return to the mother ship for repairs before continuing the quest.

To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.</desc>

This game is a side scrolling adventure, where the game field advances automatically, and the screen is divided in six different floors, all of which are populated by enemies or obstacles that will kill you if you touch them; but both Son Son and Ton Ton attack their enemies by shooting small bullets at them out of their weapons (a magic cane and a pitchfork, respectively). Their attack can also stop many enemy projectiles! Your chosen character must jump from floor to floor, evading hunters, bats, fish, statues, insects, skull coins, and mad bombers! As you advance, you can pick up several food items to increase your score. Clearing the screen of enemies will also net you several hefty bonuses.

The story is heavily based upon "Journey To The West"; the player characters as well as the kidnapped ones are based upon the main characters in the story. This game is also a port of Capcom's original arcade game.

		<desc>The beautiful Fairy Land has been ruled by the evil demon Geyla for a thousand years. You are a nameless spelunker who is searching for treasure. You are told to defeat Geyla and to free the Fairy Land. But you are unsure about your motivation. Do you really wish to save the world, or are just interested in all those treasures buried deep in mountain caves, waiting for you to find them and to pick them up? You have a special meter called Toku that will indicate exactly how much you are interested in saving the world, and how much in grabbing treasures. Your actions will influence the outcome of the story...

The gameplay is platform action with some RPG elements (such as the ability to use different weapons or to follow a specific style or behavior). You travel overworld through forests, fields, and mountains, whacking or shooting enemies, facing ferocious bosses, and descending underground, searching for treasure. There are many hazards that await you on your journey, including lava fields, pits, etc.

"Doctor Octopus is plotting the crowning caper of his criminal career... to rule the world.
He has reunited the Sinister Six and with these super-villains together again, nothing stands in their way - except Spider-Man!"

Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six is a side-scrolling game which puts you in the role of Spidey throughout six levels against Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, Vulture, Hobgoblin and Doctor Octopus respectively. Some puzzle solving (like finding a key) is necessary to beat some levels. Spidey can duck jump, climb walls, punch, shoot webs to swing (by pressing punch and jump together) and perform a jump kick (by pressing the punch button twice). Collecting web cartridges allows Spidey to shoot limited web projectiles.

Although hard to die, Spidey has only one life, there are no items to recharge life (but killing some guys will do so) and only one continue.</desc>

		<name>Splatterhouse - Wanpaku Graffiti</name>
		<desc>Wanpaku Graffiti is the first Splatterhouse game to appear on a home console. It is not clear how it fits in the series' timeline, but it starts with Jennifer mourning over Rick's grave (her boyfriend). Lightning strikes his grave and he is resurrected. Before she can rejoice, another bolt strikes the grave next to him and a jack-o-lantern appears. This pumpkin king kidnaps Jennifer and Rick barely has the time to wipe off the dust from his clothes before he sets off to rescue his girlfriend.

Although the game is not as gory as the other titles, there is still plenty of disturbing enemies such as headless chickens, severed hands and zombies. Through seven side-scrolling levels, including a graveyard, a mansion, a Japanese pagoda and an Egyptian pyramid, you chase the pumpkin king with your cleaver and a shotgun you can pick up along the road. Just like the other games in the series, there are lots of movie references. The game often needs good timing and pixel perfect jumps, as falling down from platforms will regenerate the enemies. You can pick up candy, hamburgers and cans of soda to restore your health.

		<name>Gegege No Kitarou 2 - Youkai Gundan No Chousen</name>
		<desc>Gegege no Kitarou 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen (Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Yokai Army) is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong. The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and yÅkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller. 

Gegege no Kitarou 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points. 

The map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.</desc>

		<desc>When the rulers of planet Neptune find that they are running out of their main food source – man-ham – they hit on a devious plan: Invade the nearby planet earth and melt the polar ice-caps, thus sinking all cities. Then imprison the human creatures in underwater factories where they can be turned into a fresh source of man-ham.

The plan goes perfectly. The leaders of earth's nations are taken completely by surprise as the ice-caps melt and the globe is flooded. It seems that humanity will meet its end on the dinner plates of the Neptunian monsters. But wait! One hope remains, in the form of evil pirate Narikeen, who has been the scourge of the world's nations, pillaging and causing general distress in his pink submarine, Sqoon. The leader of the world's ailing defense force turns to this former public enemy number 1, and with some difficulty manages to convince Narikeen to save the world.

In this side-scrolling shooter, you control Narikeen's sub, Sqoon. Sqoon is equipped with two weapons; an upgradable missile launcher which shoots straight ahead to take out the weird Neptunian enemies and an ice-bomb which shoots horizontally downwards to blow up factories and other installations. Destroying these buildings releases the humans inside, who then float out so you can rescue them. When you have nine people on-board, a small mobile island will appear on the surface, allowing you to drop off the humans and re-fuel. You'll need to save a lot of people and re-fuel regularly, as your sub only lasts about 60 seconds on one tank of gas. There are eight levels in the game, each set in a different (sunken) country.</desc>

Being wild children, Tom Sawyer and his best friend Huckleberry Finn are always getting into new adventures and one kind of trouble or another. So it's not entirely unexpected one day when Tom Sawyer heads off to school and realizes he is late...

Square no Tom Sawyer is a side-scrolling RPG that features characters and situations from Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer novels. Players control Tom himself and up to three other characters who can join his party at any one time. In town, there are a variety of people that can be talked to and shops where items can be bought and sold. Outside of towns, monsters and fierce woodland animals are randomly encountered and must be battled with. When entering battle mode, the game shifts to a third-person view behind Tom's party. The player can issue commands such as Fight, Item and Run to each of the characters in the party and these actions will occur in turn. Battles that are won earn the participating characters experience points. These experience points can be allocated to increase specific stats of characters. Players can accumulate new items for use in battle but never have to deal with equipping characters.</desc>

Stanley (1841-1904), a reporter for the New York City Newspaper, who was sent by his employers to chronicle the work of the famous Africa-explorer, Dr. Livingston. Unfortunately, the Doctor left without you, hating press and everything connected to it. Recently he disappeared somewhere in the jungle of Congo, leaving only a few notes. Apparently, he was on the trail of
re-discovering the legendary lost temple of the Amut people, Am-Zutuk. You decide to follow his steps, to find the lost Dr. Livingston, and maybe to learn more about the mysterious people of Amut and the temple.

The game takes you to Congo, where you can move from location to location on a "world map" with about a hundred accessible areas. You should make your way through platform levels populated with wild animals and other foes. Some of the levels are impassable or serve no purpose, others contain valuable clues and useful items. You can also visit town areas and talk to people. There is a variety of weapons to be found during your quest, including "native" ones such as blowpipe and spear.

		<desc>The Ship Enterprise is on a 5 year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. While the Enterprise is investigating strange gravitational disturbances, it is drawn into a dimensional hole and ends up in unknown space with broken warp engines. Now, Captain Kirk and his crew must try to repair the ship and find a way home.

Gameplay is divided into two parts, taking place on the ship's bridge and away missions. On the bridge, you can communicate with other ships, call up a map to navigate the ship (once the warp engines are fixed), enter battle mode to fight other ships (which does not happen very often), save the game or beam down to a planet's surface.
These away missions make up the major part of the game and play very much like other action adventures. You can talk to aliens find and use objects, solve puzzles and fight against hostile lifeforms.  Battles with other ships or on away missions are handled in simple Shoot'em Up-fashion.

Star Voyager's gameplay requires the player to venture through various sectors of the galaxy in search of different alien fleets so they can be defeated. Fuel stations are placed around sporadically and help if fuel is running low. There are several different planets that are either empty or have people that can upgrade the player's equipment to fight off the enemy fleets. These upgrades include the super laser, improved shields, and engines that enhance the ship's warping ability. Warping is a vital part of the gameplay. If players do not warp to different sectors wisely, they might end up lost, run into dangerous sectors such as the black hole or the asteroid field, or run out of fuel. The game ends if enemy ships destroy the CosmoStation Noah.</desc>

		<desc>Stealth ATF is a flight simulator in which you pilot a F-117A, a.k.a. Nighthawk in several missions.

In every mission's beginning and ending you have to take off and land your plane respectively, from a side view. If you fail to land after completing the target objectives, you fail to succeed in mission and thus have to replay it.

Your view during the flight is from inside the cockpit, and the gameplay offers total freedom of movement on flight. Your terrain is infinite, and your enemies will re-appear in your radar every time they fly out of range. You fly in different locations, such as the Middle East, Alaska, the Pacific, etc. During flight, you can also turn off the music and play with only the flight sounds.

Your mission is to defeat a fixed number of enemies each mission. Your targets will always be aerial ones. You can shoot a cannon (which ammunition is unlimited) or missiles (8 per mission). If an enemy shoots you a missile, you can try to avoid it using the stealth mode (pressing the start button) once per mission. The stealth mode will automatically turn off once you pass out of the danger. If you manage to accomplish the mission perfectly, a bonus round is offered, and you have to try to take down as many enemies as you can.

The game can be played by one or two player taking turns. A second player can also take control of the aircraft closest to the center of the radar, either in one or two player mode.</desc>

		<name>Stick Hunter - Exciting Ice Hockey</name>
		<desc>Stick Hunter: Exciting Ice Hockey is a game for the Famicom released only in Japan in 1987. It was never released in North America. Stick Hunter was the first actual ice hockey game created for a Nintendo gaming system.

The game was designed so that 1 player could play against the computer, or 2 players could play simultaneously against each other. The length of the periods and difficulty level could both be adjusted.

Playing as a character who has possession of the puck, the character could not only skate faster, but could only shoot the puck forward. So if the player wanted to pass to a teammate, the character on screen would have to be facing the person to which he's passing. The same applied to shooting at the net and attempting to score a goal. The character would have to be facing the opposing net. A player without the puck could only skate faster. If the goalie had control of the puck, he could only pass to a teammate.

As in the real-world sport of hockey, the object is to score more goals than the opposing team.</desc>

By repeatedly shooting bells that come out of the clouds, these bells will change colors, each color giving a different ability. Getting shot down releases a ghost of Stinger, which can be recollected to gain the jet's powers back.

In the two-player mode, if TwinBee (cyan craft) and GwinBee (green craft) align their flights (one behind the other) they can turn their guns into a ripple laser. The Japanese version features a three players mode, with the addition of WinBee (the magenta craft, which was removed from the US version).</desc>

It's time to recall the good old days and to embark on a quest for revenge!

Despite the US title, the game has little to do with the Street Fighter or the Final Fight games. This is an action platformer in which the player navigates Ken around, trying to avoid or kill the enemies by shooting at them with ranged weapons, adjusting the direction of the shot, or kicking and punching them. Ken is very agile and can jump high and climb walls.

Strider is a platform game where Hiryu must fight his way past enemies and uncover keys, characters and data disks (which can be analysed aboard the Blue Dragon) to find out what's going on. His primary weapon is his jumping ability and sword, the Cypher, which he uses to strike with great speed. At some point in the game, the Cypher may be modified to shoot plasma arrows. Hiryu also has a various set of "skills" which he learns as he gains levels. Examples of skills are a healing ability (Medical), a jumping ability (Jump), some additional attacks (Spark, Fire, Sp-Ball) and the ability to leave an area (Warp).</desc>

		<desc>Sugoro Quest is a genre-bender of a game. It's an RPG, but yet it has many board game elements. It may sound like a strange combination, but it works surprisingly well. It almost comes off as a tabletop RPG simulation.

The back-story is fairly simple. The Kingdom of Siland is plagued with various problems, all of which involve monsters living in caves wreaking havoc on the countryside. Of course, what kind of game would it be if there weren't fearless heroes to step in and fix things? That's where the four Dice Heroes step in. The four Dice Heroes will, of course, be under your control.

The four Dice Heroes are your basic stock-issue fantasy characters. There's the fighter, he's got a moderately high amount of strength, and a decent balance of everything. There's the dwarf, who's got plenty of strength and endurance, but he's dumb as a brick. There's the elf, who's really good at magic but has no HP and very little strength. Then there's the half-elf, who's fair and balanced. You must pick one of these characters before each level, and you're stuck with them until you finish.</desc>

In Part 1, Level 1, for instance, you have to collect the letters that make up the word ANIMAL. In subsequent levels, you have to create words that are actual animals (HORSE, RABBIT, MONKEY). Also, if you take too long to complete the level, a red genie will emerge from one of the pots and will attack you.</desc>

In this video game adaptation, the player controls the Japanese player in a competition against five opponents: Canada, USA, UK, South Korea and China. Each match is played on best-of-five sets, played to 15 (boys) or 11 (girls) points. Four different courts can be chosen.

Along the d-pad, two buttons are used to control the player - one to swing the racquet, and other to jump. By following the shadow of the shuttle the player can position himself correctly, and then hit it in perfect timing, giving it enough power and lift to reach the opponent's side, and then (hopefully) descend out of the opponent's reach. Jumping allows the player to hit the shuttle downwards but still over the net, reducing the reaction time for a proper return drastically.</desc>

Your shuttle commander has been trapped in a dimensional maze in space, and you must use your glove to throw an energy ball at the walls in order to advance.

The walls in each maze room you encounter are filled with blocks. Using your Power Glove, you have to entirely break down a wall before being allowed to advance to the next room. 

While trying to progress through the maze, your character will be under attack by a range of creature, and a wizard who wants to mess with your work. The object for the player is to find the way out of the maze and rescue the Commander.</desc>

		<name>Super Jeopardy!</name>
		<desc>Super Jeopardy! is based on the popular Jeopardy! TV game show. In this digital incarnation, 4 players compete at answering reverse trivia questions in trademark Jeopardy! fashion-- i.e., the host provides the answer and a player has to provide the questions. As many of 4 human players can participate, with the remaining slots filled by the computer. Competition takes place in quarter-final, semi-final, and final round modes.

A player will select a question from one of 6 categories. The game gives the answer to the question and the players use their controllers to buzz in. At that point, a player has 80 seconds to spell out the question (and the computer has already provided the "What is..." question preamble). In the player gets the question wrong, that player loses money and the remaining players have an opportunity to buzz in.</desc>

		<desc>Super Mogura Tataki!! Pokkun Mogura ("Super Mole Bash!! Pokkun Mole") is an action game for Famicom based on the classic fairground/arcade game "whac-a-mole". The goal is to hit the moles as they poke out from eight different spots on the ground before they quickly duck their heads back down. Later stages switch the moles with other animals and characters to quickly bop.
The game was released with a rubber mallet and a special smaller Power Pad peripheral (known in Japan as the Family Trainer) with a grid of buttons that corresponded to the holes that the moles would emerge from. Because the Power Pad had twelve buttons, the different stages could be configured differently: for instance, the first level had a ring of eight buttons on the right side of the pad, whereas the next level included the left, right, and bottom row of buttons to form its eight around an island in a U shape.</desc>

Several years after its PC Engine release, Super Momotarou Detetsu was also released on the Nintendo Famicom and Game Boy. It received a sequel in Super Momotarou Dentetsu II and a large number of successors.

The goal of the game is to travel the map and acquire territory through business deals, similar to Monopoly or Itadaki Street. Players have to contend with each other for limited resources, as well as CPU threats like the God of Poverty.</desc>

		<name>Super Real Baseball '88</name>
		<desc>Super Real Baseball '88 is a baseball game developed by Pax Softonica for the Famicom and published in Japan by Vap in 1988. After Namco excited the market for baseball games with the release of Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, many other companies attempted to meet the demand for more baseball games.

This title differentiated itself from other baseball games by obtaining permission from the Professional Baseball Organization of Japan to use the official names of the 12 Japanese baseball teams and their players. This was a groundbreaking feature at the time. It was also the first game to depict an existing stadium with it's actual name, the Tokyo Dome, which had just opened shortly before the game's release. Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time, was chosen to help promote the game.

To further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field. Despite these changes, and efforts to promote the game, it was considered very difficult to play, as it employed rather complex controls for batting, pitching, and fielding that were not easy for many players to perform.</desc>

an investigation group: Kazuo, Akiko, Taro, Asuka, and Emi. The famous painter Mamiya Ichirou lived many years in a secluded mansion, and rumor says there are some valuable frescos to find inside. Our investigators decide to take some pictures of the frescos. However, upon entering the mansion, a ghost-like figure of Mamiya appears  and threatens them. After this, they find themselves trapped in the mansion. The heroes must now find a way out of the mansion, not forgetting the frescos they came there for, and the destiny of an earlier investigation group that has disappeared under mysterious circumstances.

"Sweet Home" is perhaps the first known example of survival horror genre, created by the same company that later made the famous  Resident Evil. However, "Sweet Home" is also a console-style RPG: characters fight random monsters in turn-based battles, equip various weapons and level up. You can (and must) form different teams from the five available characters, both for battles and for solving puzzles. Each character has his (or her) own item-based skill: Taro can take pictures, Emi can unlock almost any door, Kazuo has a lighter, Akiko uses a vacuum cleaner to remove dust and other obstacles, and Asuka has medical kits.

The game was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

Little did they know how futile their quests would be -- they met a horrible fate at the hands of a horrible serpent king.  Can your party of champions defeat the dragon and claim the ruby treasures? Or will you, too, be vanquished?

Swords and Serpents is a first-person, party-based CRPG in the tradition of Wizardry.

A 16-level dungeon awaits you, full of weapons, armor, magic spells, and other valuable items.  Beware, though: an assortment of traditional fantasy beasts and villains awaits you!  

Teleporters and "zoom tubes" speed up your travels.  Temples provide safe havens for your party to restore health and mana. An auto-map feature helps the player keep track of what locations you have visited.  A password system allows you to save your progress as you travel deeper into the darkness.</desc>

		<name>Taito Chase H.q.</name>
		<desc>As an undercover agent of Chase Headquarters, your job is to patrol the streets and track down five criminals. You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".</desc>

		<desc>Taito Grand Prix: Eikou e no License is a 1987 Formula One racing video game for the Japan-exclusive Famicom. This video game takes the player through randomized street racing circuits in addition to the various circuits of the 1987 Formula One season. There are over fifteen stock car tracks and eight Formula One tracks. Open mode allows the player to practice each course individually without any pressure from anything besides the time limit. Normal mode is more restrictive; the game forces the player to roam from city to city until they end their career by winning a full season of Formula One.

There are three kinds of music (playing from a pretend cassette tape) and a blank soundtrack. The instrumental songs played in the game were: Offside Way, Crushing Light, and Faraway Dream. On the promotional flyer for this video game, a Formula One racing vehicle was shown with the Ford logo shown on the vehicle. However, there are no actual Ford Motor Company vehicles used in the entire game.</desc>

It stars Japanese comedian-turned-actor "Beat" Takeshi Kitano, who first appeared on the Famicom in the parody game Takeshi no Chousenjou. Similar to the Game of Life, players move around a board earning money and occasionally encountering events such as a minigame - in which the player can increase their wealth should they succeed - or a penalty. The game has a Sengoku era theme running throughout, from its samurai characters to the tattooed gambler that rolls a dice for determining how many places a player can move around the board that turn.</desc>

		<name>Takeshi No Chousenjou</name>
		<desc>On the surface, Takeshi no Chōsenjō (aka "The Ultimate Challenge from Beat Takeshi") is a side-scrolling adventure game, where the player character can wander the streets and buildings of Tokyo, and later the islands of the South Pacific. Various people and shop-owners can be spoken with, and frequently attacked if the player so chooses.

Kitano incorporated many of his unique and controversial ideas into the game. For instance, the player can beat up a yakuza gangster at a pachinko gambling establishment, and take the yakuza's money to exchange for prizes. The player can use a hang-glider to fly over into a strange land called the "Red Country" (an amalgam between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany). The player can gain access to the Red Country if they pass over the four other islands, but a huge mountain blocks the way into the country, and the player will be forced to crash into either the mountain or the ground, resulting in an automatic game over screen. There is also a choice on the password-entry screen ("Punch the old man") which results in an automatic game over, even when the player has not even started the game. Other in-game events include: a game over screen where the player's character is given a funeral, singing karaoke at a pub (using the second-controller's built-in microphone), the main character divorcing his wife and paying a settlement, beating up yakuza, or even punching the main character's wife and children (presumably to death).</desc>

		<desc>Based on the Disney cartoon Talespin. Baloo's airline cargo company, Higher for Hire, makes deliveries all around the world. The air pirates, lead by the daring Don Karnage have increased their attacks against air travel. In order to foil the plans of the pirates, Baloo trades in his normal plane for a "Mini Sea Duck", designed to fly more maneuverably.To get his cargo delivered on time, Baloo must fly over many dangerous areas, and also pick up any cargo stolen  or scattered by the air pirates. Eventually, the fortress of the air pirates themselves must be destroyed for air travel to remain safe and profitable.

Talespin is a side-scrolling shooter, moving left to right across the screen. The Mini-Seaduck can fire projectiles and switch direction, flying right-to-left while upside-down. The money you make from recovery of these cargo items can be used to purchase upgrades at the end of each level from Wildcat, the mechanic. Many strange boss creatures and devices will guard the final areas of most levels.

		<desc>Tatakae!! Ramen-Man: Sakuretsu Choujin 102 Gei is an adventure game developed by Human Entertainment for the Famicom and published by Bandai in 1988. It is based off the Tatakae!! Ramenman series, which itself is a spin-off of the Kinnikuman series, known in the US as M.U.S.C.L.E.. Ramenman is a popular character in the Kinnikuman universe.

The game follows the eponymous warrior Ramenman as he attempts to track down his father's killers and bring them to justice with his many years of martial arts training. Notably, this game is the first true point-and-click adventure game for the system. While there had been many adventure games made for the NES, such as Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken or Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom, they are largely driven by menus. Ramenman is directed by using the cursor to select an area to walk to or interact with instead much like classic Sierra adventure games such as King's Quest.</desc>

		<desc>The most popular American football game to hit the NES console, Tecmo Bowl pits the player vs. the computer in 11 game single-elimination playoff action, or you can go head-to-head with a human opponent in action or coach mode.  There are 12 teams of real NFL players (circa 1988) to choose from, but don't look for official NFL team logos or mascots like Bears or Dolphins--Tecmo Bowl has the NFLPA but not the NFL license.

The play perspective is top-down and the screen scrolls horizontally.  Player graphics are large and colorful, which is made possible by limiting the number of players to nine per team.  Animated cut-scenes are shown following touchdowns and at half-time, and crowds are shown filling the endzone seats.

There are four plays to choose from on offense--usually two runs and two passes. The player takes control of the quarterback before the snap and then either hands off to the running back or works through his receiver progression from the top to the bottom of the screen.  Defense consists of trying to guess which offensive play the opponent will select and then taking control of one of the defensive players before the snap.  A very simple power meter system is used for kicking field goals, extra points, and punts.

There are no game or season stats and there is no way to save your season, but there is a password feature allowing you to resume tournament play where you left off.</desc>

Play as all four of the turtle heroes, rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld.

Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.</desc>

The game is very much in the tradition of the Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter series, pitting you against opponents one at a time. Some fighters (besides the turtles) will be familiar, such as the Casey Jones, or even Shredder.

Though even people familiar with the turtles will see differences in them. They can now, for example, do moves involving projectiles, such as "fireballs".

The game's modes include a story mode, where you can only pick one of the turtles and go on fighting opponents in order to defeat the Shredder, and a tournament mode, where you fight only for the fame and money.

		<name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II : The Arcade Game</name>
		<desc>April O'Neil, the reporter friend of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, is kidnapped by the villainous Shredder and his two goons, Bebop and Rocksteady. The four ninja turtles: Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello and Leonardo fight their way through hordes of Foot Soldiers in order to rescue April. They battle familiar foes such as the mad scientist Baxter Stockman, General Traag from Dimension X and the evil alien brain Krang, up to the final showdown with Shredder himself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game is a port of the popular arcade game made by Konami during the height of the cartoon series' popularity. Depending on the version of the game, up to two, three or four players can take part in the action. The game plays like a simplified Double Dragon. While most of the standard Foot Soldier enemies are easily dispatched, some attack with knives or ray guns and are thus more dangerous. At the end of each level, players encounter a boss (or in certain cases two bosses working in tandem, such as Bebop and Rocksteady).

The NES version of the game features additional content not present in other versions of the game: two new levels (Snowy Central Park and The Dojo), new bosses (including Tora, Shogun and Baxter Stockman as a fly), additional music tracks as well as more variations of Foot Soldiers.

		<name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III : The Manhattan Project</name>
		<desc>This was the last side-scrolling Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game for NES. It followed the highly acclaimed Turtles II over a year later and, unlike its predecessor, doesn't have an Arcade counterpart.

The third game in the series is basically the same as the second. The story and the stages are different, of course, but it doesn't really matter. Choose your favourite turtle and kill as many Foot Clan soldiers as you can, fight the bosses and reach Shredder in a Double Dragon-styled game.

The graphics and gameplay were improved. And, if the choice of the turtle depended only on personal taste in the second game (as they were all the same, in different colors), in this third episode they gained individual special moves.

		<desc>It revolves around the historical Japanese figure Mito Koumon who, as a retired governor, traveled across Japan to observe other districts. Where ever he investigated, he found local inhabitants who were experiencing some problem, or observing some corruption in the local government. Mito Koumon would then investigate the situation, disguised as a commoner, only to expose both the corruption and his true identity when the mystery was completely solved. In doing so, he would improve the lives of the local inhabitants, and then move on to another district to look for more problems. The game was only released in Japan, and never translated into English. It had one sequel: Mito Koumon II: Sekai Manyuuki.</desc>

		<desc>Tenkaichi Bushi is a one-on-one martial arts fighting game set in ancient China.

Using 2D side-scrolling graphics with a distinct cartoony design, the player takes control of a single fighter as he attempts to defeat his opponent in single-round fights. Combat is controlled with a single attack button which can unleash all sorts of moves when pressed in conjunction with the directional arrows. These moves vary among each fighter, as players can choose from 15 different fighters, each with their own stats and moves, and then compete against the others to see who gets the honor of becoming grandmaster.

Additionally the game includes a story mode in which players can take control of a single martial artist and roam the countryside looking for challengers (the later done from a top-down map view). Starting abilities and health are minimal, but successfully defeating opponents will increase the player's health and allow the fighter to learn new moves and turn into the ultimate combatant.</desc>

		<desc>Tetrastar The Fighter is a 3D shooter by Home Data and published by Taito. In the year 2089, humanity forms an alliance with the intergalactic Baal empire but soon Earth finds out about the alien's true intentions. A group of resistance assembles the project Tetrastar to prepare for the potential upcoming threat. But the project lead by the general Nelson is soon put on hold and a short lived peace settles in. But the whole thing was nothing more than a hostile invasion and the Baal empire finally breaks the alliance and attacks Earth. The player's first mission is to prevent New York to be destroyed and then to retrieve Omega, the faithful robot navigator, to warp to the alien's mother world. The Tetrastar super fighter can move around the screen and fire a standard Vulcan gun. Special weapons become available later in the game from Bombs (WID), Homing Missiles (AAM), Napalm Bombs (NAP) and the powerful Bio Cannon (BIO) - they are accessible via the Select button and triggered by pressing A. They all come in limited quantities and must be refilled by picking up power-pods along the way. Tetrastar features nice stages and cutscenes between them unfold the game's episodic story.</desc>

		<name>Tetris</name>
		<desc>This version of Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, as well as the best-known (but not the only) version on Nintendo's first home console. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.

The game offers two different modes of play, "Type A" and "Type B". "Type A" is a standard endless mode, where the speed of the game increases every ten lines, with an option for the starting level when beginning the game. "Type B", on the other hand, is a race to clear 25 lines, with options for both drop speed and starting garbage. In both modes, successful play is rewarded with cute animations. There are also three different background songs to choose from.</desc>

Each play field starts with different colored dots (in this case black, gray and white), with one of each color flashing. The blocks are made up of the same three colors, and by matching blocks of the same color over the top or to the side of the dot will clear the dot and those blocks from the screen. If you clear a flashing dot, all the corresponding dots of the same color will be cleared. To complete the round just clear the dots, not the blocks themselves.</desc>

		<desc>Tetris 2 + BomBliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game. There are, naturally, two variations featured on this cartridge: regular Tetris with several modes, as well as a new game called BomBliss. Also included is a two-player battle version of regular Tetris.

Tetris mode includes three game types. First is A-Type, which is a standard endless mode that continually increases pace until the player loses. Next is B-Type, which is a race to 25 lines under increasingly tough conditions. Last is C-Type, which is similar to A-Type, but adds a continually-rising stack of garbage appearing from the bottom of the well.

BomBliss is slightly different from regular Tetris. In each stage, the well is filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of blocks.

BomBliss also includes three different modes of play. Contest mode tasks the player with clearing out a preset field in as few blocks as possible; the top three scores for each stage are saved. Puzzle mode tasks the player with clearing a preset field with a preset sequence of pieces. Last, there is Construction mode, which allows the player to build their own puzzle stages.</desc>

The little robot-boy is one of Japan's most recognizable character. The story takes place in the future, at a time where humans and robots live together in harmony. The powerful robot-boy Atom lives with Professor Ochanomizu, an old scientist who takes good care of the little robot, and helps him fight crime and injustice. One day, burglars break into Professor Ochanomizu's lab and steal all of his money. It is now Atom's duty to recover the stolen loot.</desc>

Long: Mr. Chin's stick will become longer.
1-Up: Get an extra life for Mr. Chin.
Missile: Gain fire power, press the A button to launch a missile, catch a second missile to fire two missiles simultaneously.

Slow: This will slow the speed of the ball.
3 Balls: The ball will split into three balls and as long as you keep one ball from falling you will always have three balls.
6 Balls: The ball will split into six balls.

"Bad Characters" will occasionally appear and try to mess with Mr. Chin.

1. Sea Anemone: If he captures your ball it will split into two smaller balls.
Octopus: He lives underwater inside an ancient vase, if the vase is hit by the ball the octopus will come out and try and latch onto Mr. Chin's stick.  If he succeeds he will weigh you down causing you to move slower.
Turtle: They will walk over the wall and transform themselves into new blocks to hinder your progress.
Bird: If hit with your ball it will fly out of control smashing through the walls before flying away.
Thunder Warrior: If you hit the Thunder Warrior with your ball he will release a circle of lightning bolts that will fly around him. The lightning bolts will destroy the walls but they will momentarily paralyze Mr. Chin if he is hit.</desc>

The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.)

		<desc>In the year 2050 the Earth has been attacked by the villainous Raggosians and it is your job to save the planet! You will need to pilot your ship, The Tempest, to the planets Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Earth in order to retrieve certain minerals which can be used to fight the Raggosians. The Raggosians will be trying to stop you from reaching these destinations, though, so you need to use the Nintendo zapper to fight back. Numerous (and very fast!) enemy ships will fly by on the screen and attempt to destroy your ship. You need to shoot the ships and incoming missiles before your ship takes too much damage. From time to time a comet will fly by, and if you shoot this a temporary barrier will be formed that protects your ship from enemy fire. Occasionally you can also earn a smart bomb which appears in the bottom of the screen and destroys all enemies if shot. Each level ends with a large boss which will take multiple hits to destroy.</desc>

Jerry's main defense is his unlimited supply of marbles. Pick up other items such as bubble gum, meat cleaver, cups of water, moth balls, hammer, invisible ink and drill to overcome the enemies and obstacles in your way. Make sure you outwit Tom whenever he appears.

Look for cheese power-ups and mouse hole bonus stages along the way.

		<name>Top Gun</name>
		<desc>Top Gun is loosely based on the film of the same name. It is an action game in which the player controls an F-14 Tomcat fighter through four different missions.

The action is seen from a first-person cockpit view. Depending on the mission, different kinds of targets must be destroyed. There are always enemy aircraft, but some missions include sea and ground targets as well. Two weapons are available: machine guns (with unlimited ammunition) and missiles. The player can choose from three types of missiles before a mission: the more powerful ones can only be carried in lower quantities.

Enemy aircraft either overshoot the players's plane from behind and can be easily taken down, or they come from the front and fire guns and missiles. Sometimes, an enemy plane will position itself on the player's six. It should be lost quickly by steering left and right, or instant death follows.

Halfway through missions two through four comes a refueling sequence where the fuel plane's nozzle must be aligned with one's aircraft.

Every mission (except the first one) features a final mission target, which can take a lot more damage than regular targets.

Each mission concludes with a landing attempt on the aircraft carrier. To successfully land, the player's plane must have a certain altitude and speed. Successfully landing gives bonus points, but crashing the plane doesn't end the game - it simply costs a life.</desc>

		<desc>Just like in the first game, you fly an F-14 Tomcat in combat against the enemy equipped with Soviet equipment, although there is no direct reference to the Soviet Union anywhere. The only plot of this game is to destroy everything you see, excluding the aircraft carrier to which you must land at the end of each level.

In addition to the basic game mode with anti-ship, ground attack and space battle levels, similar to the first game, the second mission adds two extra modes. In the first extra mode you can fight against top enemy aces flying a MiG-25 Foxbat, one at a time. The second extra mode is two-player game with split screen, in which you can fight against your friend, both flying Tomcats.

You will have to fight against interesting level bosses such as a giant Tu-160 Blackjack bomber, a Mi-24 Hind attack chopper and an armed space shuttle.

Another interesting detail about the game is that between fighting the aircraft and surface opponents you have to dodge between giant trees (yes, you read correctly!!), lightnings and laser attacks.

		<name>Total Recall</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1990 Schwarzenegger film of the same name, Total Recall for the NES generally adheres to the movie's plot across its nine levels. Unlike the various PC iterations, this title was created by Interplay and published by Acclaim.

Players control Doug Quaid as he platform hops across Earth and Mars in search of his stolen memories and the responsible parties. A collection of police, soldiers, and creatures will try to stop him. Quaid's default attack is a strong punch, though guns can be knocked away from some guards and picked up for use. Cutscenes between certain levels tell the movie's plot, and feature likenesses of the actors from the film (including Arnold).

Sequences in the film are also replicated more tightly than in the PC versions. Quaid will be chased by henchman Richter in the first level, and must battle his wife inside their apartment. The security x-ray scanner takes up a level, as does the subway battle after. The player will also commandeer a Martian taxi for a driving level inside the colony, and windows can be shot out on Mars, sucking out any unfortunate baddies nearby.</desc>

One day, during his training, Jake is attacked by surprise by unknown foes who kidnap Allison, his girlfriend. Then, Jake has to save her and discover what lies behind that attack.

This game is a side-scrolling one, with the basic controls common to many of those games that fall in the same category: moving, jumping and shooting. Your basic weapon is something like an energy ball that can be charged by holding the button for a few seconds until its maximum power. Although Jake is supposed to still be learning his magic from Zebediah, from the very beginning you can use all his magical powers. You can select which magic you want to use from a list, displayed when you press the start button. The magical powers available include healing, time stopping, invincibility, the power of the elements (fire, watter, wind and earth) and 3 different metamorphosis. You can morph into a flying guy who throws something like a boomerang (that doesn't come back), a fish-like guy, who throws something like ninja stars and can swim, and a feline-like guy, who releases electrical shocks from his hands and becomes invincible while jumping. You do not evolve during the game, as your health and magic bar doesn't grow.

Totally Rad, as the name points out, is a game full of slang, with the constant use of words like totally, gnarly, dude, excellent, decent, righteous, etc.</desc>

The game features 7 worlds each containing 5 stages (except for the 1st and 3rd world where each contain only 4 stages). Most of the game involves controlling Thrilla on a skateboard, dodging or jumping over various obstacles and enemies while attempting to get to the end of the stage. There will also be times when Thrilla will get to be on a surfboard, but gameplay remains the same as it was on the skateboard. Thrilla also rides a shark underwater with the goal still being to get to the end of the stage while either dodging enemies or throwing spears at them. There are also boss battles where Thrilla throws either coconuts or spears trying to deplete all the health of his adversary. 

There is also a shell game between stages which allows the player to obtain extra lives. The game also contains powerups throughout its levels such as a banana which restores health.</desc>

The skating section (called Street Skate Session) is a side scrolling action game where you need to navigate through an obstacle course within the given time limit. Ideally you want to earn as many points as possible by performing tricks, jumping over items, and collecting bonuses. If you crash too many times (or fall into a hole, run out of time, etc...) then the game will be over. In the surfing section (called Big Wave Encounter) you need to surf a giant wave all the way to the beach. As with skating, you can earn points by performing tricks and collecting bonuses; likewise the game ends if you crash too many times. You can choose to play either game individually, or alternate between the two (the Wood &amp; Water Rage option).

To find it out, Ultra Magnus must travel through a set of platform-style worlds and fight a range of bosses, ranging from the Megatron, through the combiner series to a flying Decepticon emblem(!).

Ultra Magnus starts out in robot mode, where he can jump far but his shots travel only halfway across the screen. Press down, and Magnus transforms into a trailer. In trailer mode, he can pass below the planes as well as shoot upwards. When a plane is shot down, it transforms into a robot, which must be killed with the forward-pointing shot. Later on, the game becomes more platform-oriented.</desc>

Up to two players can play in a race to gather up the Trog eggs as quickly as possible.  The first player to get all eggs of their colour wins the round.  Of course, Trogs also love the taste of Spike and Bloop, and will use cavemen inventions such as fire and the wheel to catch them and gobble them up!  Luckily, the Dinos can fight back - eating a pineapple will turn them into a monstrous T-Rex that can chow down on Trogs, while a hot tamale lets them breathe fire.

		<name>Trolls on Treasure Island</name>
		<desc>Samantha and Norbert, two teenage troll twins, were windsurfing one day and came upon an undiscovered and uncharted island. They recalled that once long ago their grandfather had told them of an island that contained lost treasures. So the twin trolls decide to explore the island to see if they can obtain these treasures.

Trolls on Treasure Island involves the same type of gameplay found in Dudes with Attitude. In this puzzle game, the player controls one of the trolls as they bounce back and forth across the screen trying to acquire the jewels on the playfield. The one caveat is that the players troll has to match the color of the jewel he or she is trying to collect. To become the correct color to snatch up the jewels, the player has to bounce across a paint can that will change your trolls hair to that of the same color as the paint can. The object in each puzzle is to retrieve all the treasures in a room without their character falling prey to the various enemies in rooms or running out of time.

The game offers 32 levels to navigate through and the player is also able to create their own level with the custom level editor.

This is an unlicensed NES game.</desc>

		<name>Tsuppari Wars</name>
		<desc>Tsuppari Wars ("Delinquent Wars") is an action video game for the Family Computer. The object is to acquire all of the enemies' territory and defeat the evil gang leaders. Even though this game was only released in Japan, the gangsters fight without any weapons and the violence level is mild compared to later gang-related games. Its spiritual descendant is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas due to its simulation of gang warfare.
Once the main gang leader is defeated in either Tsuppari Wars or Tsuppari Suku mode, the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently, all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the "neutral gangs." These "neutral gangs" will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue, or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying "no" when asked to fight ("Struggle").</desc>

You will fight small helicopters, tanks and stationary guns, defeat the large helicopters to get power-ups. By picking up colored icons (blue, yellow, red or green) you can change to different weapon types. Blue is a forward spread shot, yellow is a four-way shot, red is a wide forward laser shot and green is a continuous forward laser shot.

At the end of each section, you land on a carrier ship and count up your bonuses.</desc>

		<name>Twinbee</name>
		<desc>TwinBee is a vertical scrolling shooter. The players control cartoon-like spacecrafts with anthropomorphic arms, player one being TwinBee and player two being WinBee. The spacecrafts can be moved in all 8 directions, with one button for regular shooting flying enemies and one button for dropping ground bombs.

Power-ups in the form of bells can be collected by shooting clouds. The color of the bell will change if it is shot by the player, assuming one of the possible colors:

1. Yellow: grants bonus points;
2. White: upgrades player's guns to a twin cannon;
3. Blue: increases player's speed (up to five levels);
4. Green: creates image copies of the craft for more firepower;
5. Red: provides a shield to sustain damage.

The green and red bells cannot be combined. Alternate power ups can be collected from the ground, such as an alternate bell which upgrades the craft with a three way gun and a star which destroys all enemies on screen.

One shot in the middle section of the craft will destroy it. Shots which hit one of the craft's arms will destroy only the arm. If both arms are lost, the craft won't be able to shoot bombs anymore and will have to be repaired by an ambulance.

In the two-player mode, TwinBee (cyan craft) and WinBee (red craft) have the same speed and they can join "hand-to-hand" and fire a super blast. Also in two player mode, if one craft is hit by the other from behind, it will fire four multi-directional shots.</desc>

		<desc>Third game in the Twinbee series of vertically-scrolling surreal cute 'em ups. Once again you take the role of either Twinbee or Winbee (Gwinbee having been kidnapped by the final boss) as they fly through the fantasy kingdom shooting the hell out of their... uhm... enemies, or whatever they are.

As in other games in the series you can gain power-ups after defeating certain amounts of enemies by shooting the magical bells they leave behind, depending on the amount of times you shoot them, they change color and thus give different power-ups such as multiple shots, options, etc.

If correctly powered-up both ships can join-up to perform a screen-clearing attack, and you can choose your starting stage from any of the first four stages (the fifth and last remaining locked until you clear all the others).

		<desc>Space Defence Force SDF is a vertically scrolling space shooter. Though it scrolls vertically, you are granted some movement horizontal movement as well. The action isn't frantic, but the game is still somewhat difficult due to tight enemy attack waves and the possibility of being shot in the back. For this reason, you should not let enemies pass unscathed, since they may shoot back at you from off-screen. At some points, power up capsules will materialize in space. They will grant you not only greater firepower, but also serve as a reconfigurable armor, which is SDF's main selling point. The armor may be moved from your front to your back, and while it is moved in a large arc, it will destroy any enemies it happens to ram. When fastened to your rear, it will also grant a small speed boost. Learning to use the armor is the key to surviving in this game.</desc>

You begin play as Hebereke (Bop Louie in PAL regions), a penguin (though in PAL release he is more humanoid and looks like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man), and must explore the world on which you and three other friends crash landed. As you encounter the new characters you must fight them to make them recover their memory.  Once you have recovered all 3 other characters you are then searching for Temple Keys which will lead back to your homeworld of Ufouria.

The world in which you interact is free form, meaning that you can wander around as you please. To get to new areas you will need to get power-ups and/or new characters with their own abilities. Character switching is done as needed, not defined by levels.  Sections of the game have bosses and mini-bosses which include the characters which have not had their memory returned yet.

Unified by the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed Britannia. Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar.</desc>

In Ultima V, you, the Avatar and Hero of Britannia, are called back to deal with a new threat - the tyrant Blackthorn, who, after the disappearance of Lord British, now rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. Behind Blackthorn are the Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three Principles. Their meaning and origin are explored later in the game, rounding out an immersive world and very meaningful plot.

The Ultimate League Soccer championship let the player choose one of 8 national teams: France, England, United States, Argentina, Italy, Brazil, Australia or Germany. The other championship available restricts the choice to the 4 first teams: France, England, United States and Argentina. Each national team has its own characteristics, varying in offensive, defense, speed, skill, accuracy and experience traits.

After selecting the team, players are prompted to choose the color of their team's uniform, among white, green, gray and red. They are also prompted to choose the duration of the periods (15, 30 or 45 minutes - which run faster than real time). They are also prompted to choose team formation: 4-3-3, 4-2-4 or 4-4-2.

The game is played from a side-scrolling perspective. While conducting the ball layers can make short passes (with button B) or strong kicks (with button A, stronger the longer the button is held). Without the ball's possession, players can try to steal the ball (with button A) or skip to the next player (with button B). The goalkeeper control is manual, and players can make the goalkeeper jump (by pressing button A). Tied matches are decided on a penalty kick contest.

Players can also watch single computer vs. computer matches.</desc>

		<desc>Dr. Evil has kidnapped the scientist Jenny Aykroyd and it's the Ultimate Stuntman's job to rescue her.

Ultimate Stuntman must fight through 7 worlds with 4 stages each and then through the final world which consists of 3 stages. The game has a variety of different gameplay types. The stages go in the order of an overhead view stage, a side-scrolling stage, a climbing stage with the Android boss, and then a bomb disposal stage.

The overhead view stages deal with you driving either a car, boat, glider, or a dune buggy and trying to get to the end before time runs out on the clock. You must do this while either dodging or shooting enemies. In all the stages besides the one where you're given a glider you can use a limited number of turbo boosts to speed up your vehicle. In the glider stages you can alter your altitude to either go high above or below various obstacles. All of these levels end with a boss battle.

Sometimes after these stages there is a bonus round where you try to collect extras in a limited amount of time without crashing into any obstacles. Completing this successfully will yield an extra life.

The side-scrolling stages consists of two different experiences. One is a platformer where you walk around and can shoot enemies while searching for a set number of keys to unlock a forcefield at the end of the stage. The other consists of you flying a glider throughout a stage shooting enemies and trying not to crash until you get to the end of the stage.

The climbing stages consist of you climbing a building and shooting enemies with a reticle that you can move all over the screen.You have to get to the top of the building before time runs out. Once at the top you will have to fight an android boss. Such as Mega Slug, Techno Beast, and the Sand Yeti. The android boss fights take place on the buildings rooftops with a side view of the action. The player must drain the energy from the androids by repeated shooting bullets into them.

In the bomb disposal stage you must dispose of a bomb before the fuse burns all the way detonating it. You dispose the bomb by unsoldering chips away from each other. The player must use the directional pad to move the cursor from chip to chip keeping an eye on the number on each one. Every time the cursor moves to a certain block, the number on it decreases by one. This creates a puzzle-like scenario, where if the player makes a mistake he must reset the disposal and try again with less time.</desc>

		<name>Ultraman Club - Kaijuu Daikessen!!</name>
		<desc>Ultraman Club: Kaijuu Dai Kessen!! is an action platformer for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Ultraman Club: Great Kaiju Battle is a pretty simple platformer, typical of the NES era. You walk generally right/up and beat up various bad guys from the Ultraman franchise. You can also use sub-weapons and switch between them at will. Every once in a while you get a balloon popping minigame where you can win various prizes.

One thing to keep in mind, though, is that several of the Ultramen look VERY similar, with the only real differences in their artwork being around the shoulder area. This can cause a bit of confusion as to who is speaking. Just remember that after beating a boss, Ultraman Zoffy speaks to your Ultraman, your Ultraman isn't talking to himself!

After working out how text is formatted in this game, hacking it was fairly straight-forward, although the script had to be trimmed down to fit into the available space. The planet names in-between stages have proven difficult, though, so they have been left untranslated for the time being.</desc>

		<desc>It is a typical RPG based on the Ultraman series and its Ultra Warriors, as well as
various enemies and locales from the anime. Honestly, this game is REALLY clunky and slow for a game late in the Famicom's cycle. It is also extremely
frustrating due to the high amount of random enemy encounters, and overall slow pace of the game (and its battles). The menu system is not intuitive at
all, and it is annoying to navigate. Luckily it is a relatively short game, so if you can deal with fighting every 10 steps or so, check this out. Other
than that, you are really not missing much.

The Uncanny X-Men is an over-head view action game. Players begin by choosing two X-Men from the roster (the second either controlled by another player or the computer) and select one of five levels including a practice level. The goal in each level is to reach the hidden 'command center' and destroy it. The X-Men all share similar abilities, being able to move in any direction, jump and attack. Half of the characters (Storm, Iceman, Cyclops) have long range attacks while the other half (Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus) must get in close range to punch the enemies. Each X-men can only sustain a certain number of hits before being defeated. Should the two X-Men both fall in battle, players will be able to choose two more to attempt the level again until all of the X-Men are used up.

Power-ups include an "S" which stops time, invincibility for a short time and a health restore. There is also a Magnet (symbol of Magneto) power-down which renders the X-men immobile for a short time.</desc>

While driving on a lonely road at night, a strange figure blocks your vision causing you to swerve and crash your car. When you regain consciousness, you find that your brother is missing (in the NES-Version it's your sister who is missing). The only place he could have gone is a creepy old mansion which looms in front of you. With nowhere else to go, you enter the mansion in search of your brother. It turns out the mansion once belonged to an old wizard and his apprentice, and somehow it has become infested with the Undead.</desc>

		<name>The Untouchables</name>
		<desc>The Untouchables is based on the 1987 film by Brian De Palma and works to correspond to the movie's plot outline. In 1920s Chicago, Eliot Ness and his small crew of law enforcement professionals are determined to bring down Al Capone and his gang. 

The game features 7 levels of action named The Street, The Warehouse, The Bridge, The Alleys, The Train station, The Hostage, and The Rooftop. Some of the levels feature traditional jumping and shooting action. Other levels pit you against the gangsters in a first person shooter-style of gameplay where your character begins behind a wall, wraps around into an open area, and must take out the bad guys. When your character runs out of ammo, he slips back behind the wall to reload. These levels are accompanied with time limits and goals for the number of enemies you must kill.</desc>

The first person to knock the other into the open manhole is the winner. Only punches are allowed, although obstacles such as falling flower pots can occur and give one player the advantage. Also, everyone is to look innocent should the police drive by.

This is a very early and simplistic fighting game. As mentioned, each player can only punch the other, trying to knock them off the screen and towards one of the waiting manholes.</desc>

		<name>Urusei Yatsura - Lum No Wedding Bell</name>
		<desc>Players take on the role of Lum, a female alien princess from the anime / manga Urusei Yatsura. The game shows Lum going through different stages of her life (from childhood to adulthood) fighting off alien invaders, until she is finally old enough to marry Ataru.

Gameplay stages involve climbing up several floors of a building in order to get to a waiting UFO. Lum can't dilly-dally though, as the building she is climbing up is on fire and the flames are constantly rising. Enemies are also in the way to impede Lum's path. Lum can shoot at these enemies with lightning bolts. Lum can also pick up power-ups such as ones that can increase the players score, grant her temporary invincibility, and let her enter a bonus stage where Lum has to shoot down flying enemies.

This game was also released in the arcades as Momoko 120. However, the graphics were altered because it lacked the Urusei Yatsura license.</desc>

Among other convention-flouting novelties that the game offers are a series of fake title screens that the player must pass through at the start, and the allowance of the main character to traverse the background at times to bypass pits of spikes that otherwise appear impossible to cross

In addition, the character's attack requires the player to hold down the attack button as the game cycles through the possible special moves with the more powerful attacks only highlighted for a short period of time.</desc>

The game does look like a typical strategy game, in which the player moves all units per turn, until a character enters close combat (by moving unto the enemy). Here the character rides on a bike and tries to shoot a set number of enemies within 1 minute while trying to not being hit. For each hit the character receive experience and eventually level ups.</desc>

But something new has appeared on the scene, a neon gel with great addictive properties. During investigations as to the origin of the gel, Reese mysteriously disappears and leaves Hart without a lead. Time passes and Hart becomes romantically involved with his new partner, Christy, as he continues trying to track down the gel. But Hart is about to get a brand new lead...

Vice: Project Doom is a game that features both overhead driving modes and side-scrolling platform adventure sequences. Hart's vehicle can accelerate or slow down and fire his weapon straight ahead. During side-scrolling sequences, Hart can jump, duck, climb or use his selected weapon. Weapons that can be selected include a Katana sword, a pistol and a grenade-type weapon. These weapons feature limited ammunition with the exception of the katana. Power-ups include ammunition, coins, and health.

During both of these sequences, Hart must fight and maneuver his way past enemy foes to confront a boss. By destroying the boss and completing the level, Hart progresses and learns a bit more about the origins of the neon gel and what Project Doom is all about. Cinematics dialog between the levels tell the tale in a style similar to that of Ninja Gaiden.

In this game, the player takes control of Muttley, the grumbling, but loyal dog from the popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon. His master Dastardly sends his on three different missions, each taking place in a different location, which in its turn is divided into smaller levels. 

Muttley has to complete those levels in a rather standard platformer fashion, moving from left to right, jumping, overcoming obstacles and fighting various creatures and boss enemies from the cartoon movie. The dog's primary weapon is, unsurprisingly, his own mouth - biting regular enemies will usually lead to their instant death. Muttley can also collect bones scattered across the levels, which will grant him powerful weapons and skills of limited use, such as a bomb, a projectile attack, and the ability to heal.</desc>

		<desc>Wagan Land is a platform game series released produced by Namco (now Namco Bandai Games) that has been sold exclusively in Japan.

The series stars Wagan, a mysterious creature resembling a green mechanical dinosaur who must protect his homeland of Wagan Land from the mad scientist Dr. Devil. The games features standard side-scrolling stages where the player must reach the goal, as well as boss encounter where the player must compete in a mini-game such as concentration and shiritori. 

The objective of the game is to reach the end of each action scene by making the best use of Wagan's sound wave attacks and jumping ability. The player must confront a boss at the end of certain stages, but instead of actually fighting the boss in battle, the player is challenged to a mini-game where they must score more points than their opponent. The graphics in this installment featured simple backgrounds with bright colors. The boss theme that was later used in Wagan Land 2 and Super Wagan Land was first used in this installment for the shiritori and concentration mini-games.</desc>

There are also space shooter, driving, and puzzle levels. After certain levels you can choose different paths which consist of different stages.</desc>

Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down, the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.
There are four different ways to pick up objects. The A button lets Toad pick up the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.</desc>

The game features two types of gameplay. First, players start out in the Space World. Players control the monster fighter from a top down perspective. The player is equipped with a weapon that can be used to fire at the enemy monsters. The monster fighter can only walk in the four cardinal directions and thus only fire straight forward in whatever direction he is currently facing. The objective is to eliminate all the enemy monsters from the playfield to clear a level. Also, eliminating three monsters of the same type and color in a row, will cause a special monster to appear which can be shot for bonus points. Sometimes these special monsters will carry one letter of the word EXTRA. Collecting all five letters of that word will give the player an extra life.</desc>

		<name>WCW World Championship Wrestling</name>
		<desc>WCW: World Championship Wrestling is an isometric  wrestling game of the National Wrestling Alliance. 
Players can choose to engage in one- or two-player matches as either 1vs1 solo bouts or 2vs2 tag-teams. Upon selecting a mode, players choose their characters from among twelve featured wrestlers from the NWA league. Licensed characters include: Rick Flair ("Nature Boy"), Sting, Lex Luger ("Total Package"), Mike Rotunda, Road Warrior Hawk, Road Warrior Animal, Steve Williams (""Dr. Death"), Kevin Sullivan ("Gamemaster"), Ricky Steamboat ("The Dragon"), Ric Steiner ("Dogface Gremlin"), Eddie Gilbert ("Hotstuff") and Michael P.S. Hayes. Each wrestler has unique abilities not shared by the other wrestlers, including finishing moves and rope toss.

Prior to a match, the player is presented with a menu of eight "moves", of which the player chooses four to assign to the points of the directional pad. Once the match starts, the player is only able to use the four moves selected and the rope toss to attack the opponent. Each wrestler can move up, down, left and right inside the wrestling ring, climb the turnstiles at each corner and throw opponents out of the ring (where they will be disqualified if outside for 20 seconds). Each wrestler has a high damage "finisher move" which can only be performed when they are standing in the middle of the ring and the opponent's stamina bar is low.

		<name>Werewolf : The Last Warrior</name>
		<desc>An evil leader and his gang of bio-engineered monsters has taken over the land and only one man stands in their way. Only he's not a man, he is a lycanthrope, a person able to transform into a terrible werewolf to let loose his anger.

You start the game in human form. The human can punch, jump, move and shoot a powered up shot which moves horizontally across the screen.  By finding a Red "W" icon, the human is able to transform into a mighty werewolf creature. Accidentally grabbing a blue "W" icon or losing too much energy will change you back into a mere human being. The werewolf form offers higher jumps, quicker speed, greater strength, a shockwave attack and the ability to climb walls, so naturally you'll want this form whenever possible.  Additionally the werewolf form has an anger meter that is augmented by collecting orbs. After 5 such orbs, the werewolf will transform yet again into a SUPER werewolf with even greater strength, speed and partial invincibility.

There are 5 stages in all. Each with a boss who moves in a distinct pattern.</desc>

Gameplay is similar to other action RPGs and The Legend of Zelda. Willow is seen from a top down perspective and all enemies are visible on screen. Slaying enemies will give Willow experience points, which will eventually lead to him increasing his stats automatically. New weapons, shields and magic items are found in various treasure chests scattered across the land or given to Willow as part of the plot.

		<desc>Win, Lose or Draw was a popular TV show requiring artistic skills and an ability to think laterally. A player on your team draws something on the big game board, and you must work out what it represents. They will be common expressions depicted literally, such as 'bright idea' showing a light bulb over somebody's head, and 'cabin fever' as a rickety building next to a man with a thermometer in his mouth. 

In this computerised implementation the drawing phase of the game is handled by the computer, so your task is simply to guess the meaning of the picture by thinking laterally. Your team has 60 seconds, and you can guess repeatedly, but the picture takes time to take shape. If you fail to guess correctly, the opposition has 15 seconds to guess it (with a single try) to steal the money.

Thankfully, a king of the Rameru family gained possession of the wing and ordered that it be hidden away in a cave so peace would finally reign between the warring nations, and peace did indeed reign, for a while at least. Hundreds of years later, a descendant of the king, named Darutos, stumbled upon the location of the wing and decided to use it for his own ends. He summoned demons to take over his family's castle to claim it as solely his own. The remaining Rameru family line now have formed an alliance to gain back the castle and put a stop to Darutos.

		<name>Wizardry : Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</name>
		<desc>The first Wizardry game was one of the original CRPG dungeon crawlers, and stands along with  Ultima and  Might &amp; Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre. You generate and control a party of up to six different adventurers and send them into a 3D vector dungeon to fight monsters and find treasure.

The game takes place in the domain of Trebor, the titular Mad Overlord. Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth is in fact his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard (and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process). Thus your goal in the game is to descend to the tenth floor of the labyrinth, defeat Werdna, and retrieve the fabled amulet.

		<desc>A generation has passed since your band of adventurers reclaimed the Staff of Gnilda and the armor of the Knight of Diamonds, and the land has been at peace. But now nature itself seems to be attacking the land of Llylgamyn, as earthquakes and tidal waves ravage the land. The Sages believe the Orb of Scrying is the city's salvation, but it is guarded by the dragon L'kbreth. A band of explorers must once again venture forth in search of the Orb.

Legacy of Llylgamyn is the third entry in the Wizardry series. Like its predecessors, it is a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game in which the player assembles a party of up to six characters and explores a large maze-like dungeon, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and occasionally returning to the game's only town to rest, buy supplies, and outfit the characters. Characters must be imported from either the first or the second game. 

Character classes, combat system, and overall gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the two previous games. Good, evil and neutral alignment, however, plays a larger role. While the first level of the dungeon is accessible to everyone, the other five levels impose alignment restrictions, requiring the party either to have at least one good or bad character, or contain no neutral characters.</desc>

		<desc>The third installment of Wizards &amp; Warriors for the NES divulges during the intro that the evil wizard Malkil was not actually vanquished at the end of the second game. In fact, after the mighty battle with the hero Kuros, Malkil retreated to a nearby self-contained castle kingdom and conducted a hostile takeover. Kuros comes on the scene and must attempt to relieve Malkil of his ill-gotten command of the kingdom, its subjects, and especially its princesses.

The third game in the Wizards &amp; Warriors NES franchise features a similar feel to the first two games in that Kuros' movements are very quick and nimble. The player also has the ability to control Kuros' sword swing movements. However, Kuros has three different character classes to alternate between-- the knight, the thief, and the wizard. Each represents trade-offs between speed, attack strength, and defense strength. There are various guilds throughout the game devoted to training knights, thieves, and wizards where the player must complete challenging obstacle courses in order to increase their character class level.

The gameplay proceeds up a large vertical city/castle with dangerous, monster-filled hallways and caverns. Kuros must kill monsters, gather money, buy goods and services, raise his character class levels, rescue a variety of apprehended princesses and gather special jewels, all in a quest to face off with Malkil once again.

		<desc>World Champ is a boxing game that has many similarities to Data East's Ring King. You can play a one player "Ranking" mode, where you can build your boxer's stats up while climbing the ladder to eventually challenge for a championship in one of the four weight classes. There is also a two player vs. mode where you and a friend can square off. A tournament mode allows up to 8 players participate in a bracketed tournament.

Gameplay consists of each boxer moving around the ring trying to land jabs, hooks, and uppercuts. The goal is to either knock your opponent out for a 10-count or have the most points on the scorecard at the end of the allotted amount of rounds.</desc>

		<name>Xexyz</name>
		<desc>It's the year 2777. Due to nuclear wars and natural disasters, Earth's population has decreased dramatically and only five island are left, forming the nation of Xexyz. In Xexyz, humans, spirits and faeries have lived peacefully for centuries under the reign of King Xeu Star. One day, Xexyz is attacked by Goruza who murders the king, builds mechanical castles on each island and captures the queen of each island. You take on the role of a soldier named Apollo who wants to put an end to Goruza's reign.

Controlling Apollo, it is your task to free all five islands. Freeing an island is done in several different phases that feature 'Jump'n Shoot' as well as 'Shooter' levels (called "Action Mode" and "Shooting Mode"). The first level of each island is a Jump'n Shoot level that contains many doors to shops, bonus games, friendly NPCs or mid-bosses. NPCs will sometimes give you important hints, items or weapons; bonus games can be played to win some money ("Balls"); defeating mid-bosses (and thereby freeing a Fairy) will get you a cash reward and shops also offer weapons and items. Weapons differ largely in attack power and range. Items have temporary effects such as invincibility or improved jumping abilities. In an island's first level, you will have to find a secret room and defeat a boss, for which you will receive a Force Star that is needed to gain access to a mechanical castle. Mechanical castles look similar to other Jump'n Shoot levels but are more complex.

Once you have made your way to a "Cyborg Rider", a self-scrolling Shooter sequence starts in which you have to shoot your way through lots of enemies while picking up speed and weapon power-ups.
At the end of this sequence you will leave the Cyborg Rider, and step onto a floating platform for a boss fight. After the boss is defeated, another Shooter sequence with another boss at the end awaits, but this time, the boss if fought from the Cyborg Rider. After defeating this boss, you start the process over with a Jump'n Shoot level.

		<desc>You are Adol (Aron in Sega Master System version) Christian, a red-haired adventurer and expert swordsman. One day you encounter a fortuneteller who sends you on a quest to find information about the six books of Ys. It appears that there was once an ancient land called Ys, whose secret was sealed in those six books. Before long you learn that the six books were all stolen by the evil wizard Dark Fact (Dulk Dekt in Sega Master System version, Malificus in PC version). It is your task to defeat the villain and to discover the secret of Ys!

Ys is an action RPG with original combat: instead of pressing the "attack" button, you simply run into the enemies you encounter. You do more damage if you run into them from the back or from the sides - a head-to-head collision might result in Adol's death if the monster is stronger than him. You gain gold and experience points for defeating your foes; once you have gained enough experience, you level up and become stronger. You can buy and equip swords, armor, shields, and other accessories.

		<desc>This is the second game in the long-running Ys action RPG series. A bright light shot up from Dahm Tower in the end of the first game, and our hero Adol Christian is awakened by a young girl who finds him lying on the ground. She introduces herself as Lilia and tells Adol he is in the land of Ys. Finally he was able to establish a connection between his world and this mysterious land! But finding the gateway to Ys is not enough: Adol must stop the evil entity that his archenemy Dark Fact served. And his foes already know where he is...

This game is a direct sequel to what PC players know as  Ancient Land of Ys (of which the original NES version was simply called Ys), and is also the same game (story-wise) as the second part of Ys: Book I &amp; II for TurboGrafx CD. The gameplay utilizes an unusual action RPG combat style, where you don't press any attack button, but run into your enemies in order to cause damage. You should choose the angles and the measure of contact with the enemy carefully, otherwise you'll be dead. You can (and should) level up, perform quests for village people, gather money, and upgrade your weapons and inventory, like in any other RPG.

Ys III breaks away from the "bumping into enemies" battle system of the first two games and allows Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions.  As well as changing the battle system, the game is now side scrolling instead of the previous games top-down view. Adol also now has the ability to jump.  Not new to the series is the use of magical rings which give Adol different powering up abilities such as healing and shielding.  The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.

On board are special weapons to help you blast your way through twelve screens of enemy creatures and destroy the system's home base. Zanac is divided into 12 "areas", which look like planets. The various locations range from deserts to jungles and from oceans to industrial zones, featuring many different types of enemies.

Zanac's unique artificial intelligence program can intensify the action based upon your level of skill. The better you are, the more powerful "The System". Examples of the A.I. (but not limited to) in this game: the enemies are generally coming randomly with their behavior based on factors like the position your ship in the screen, the place you last died; the shoot speed of the enemies and bosses do also vary.

At the end of each area (level) you'll have to fight the area boss. Area bosses are mainly based around huge, screen-filling bunker bases consisting of gun turrets and a "core". You have limited time for fighting against the area boss - a time out could mean failure in entering the next stage, and with the time running, more and more enemies were attacking as penalty.

The second stage takes place in an acid rain-drenched forest. Zen must revive the flowers in the forest with his photon stick while beating off acid rain-spewing floating mechanical devices.

The next stage takes place on an off shore oil rig that is going up in flames.

		<desc>In a game reminiscent of both Road Fighter and Rally Bike, the player takes control of a motorcyclist who's in a race to be the first to traverse the United States from the west to the east coast, starting in Los Angeles and ending up in New York City.

Gameplay consists of the player dodging cars and other roadway hazards on their way to the next checkpoint. Players can either accelerate or hit the brakes on their motorcycle so they can avoid getting into an accident. Accidents cause the player to lose fuel and running out of fuel can end the game. So players must keep an eye out on the fuel gauge, which can be refilled by fuel barrels littered throughout each stage. Each car the player passes betters their ranks which increases their score.</desc>

		<desc>In 1999 a mysterious object crashes into the desert and a mysterious creature, Darc Seed appears. Using magnetic powers, he soon turns the people of the United States into zombies and exerts influence over various weapons and objects. Among the weapons Darc Seed claims is the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi hears about this, he sets out for the United States to defeat Darc Seed and reclaim the sword.

What makes this so unusual however is that "great head of the samurai" is to be taken literally and Namakubi therefore is a giant disembodied head. His main weapon is the ability to shoot projectiles from his eyes and bombs from his mouth which he fires at various enemies, objects and buildings. Furthermore, should a zombie hostage fall out a window he can rescue them to slowly power up his attacks.

The game is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player can control Namakubi's movement across the screen and the ability to shoot. Enemies reduce health by varying amounts, health can be restored by increasing the player's score. The game features four distinct stages with 2 difficulty settings.</desc>

		<desc>Zunou Senkan Galg ("Brain Battleship Galg"), referred to as just Galg by the game's title screen, is a vertical-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player must navigate a serious of canyon-like environments for missing pieces to a war machine. Each stage has at least one piece, so the player must visit them all in order to find the necessary number. In addition to this, there are numerous secrets hidden throughout the many stages of the game, and the player frequently has to choose between multiple paths which lead to different stages. The game advertises itself as a "RPG" on its box art, referring to this additional layer of complexity.

Like The Tower of Druaga, it is considered a historically important game in Japan for the amount of secrets and mysteries it contains and the subsequent difficulty involved in reaching the end without this hidden knowledge. Therefore, it was one of the earliest games for the Famicom to feature its own printed game guide for players to follow. Zunou Senkan Galg is almost entirely unheard of outside of Japan, however, and has never seen a release outside of its native country.

Though it was published by dB-Soft, the game was developed by a group named "Team Bioteckers". Galg is their only known video game credit.</desc>

The game was developed by Natsume and plays quite similar to their other title - Shatterhand. It’s a sidescrolling action game where the player has to shoot, kick, jump and duck to overcome a plethora of baddies. Before the player selects a stage, they have to select one of five heroes, each with their own amount of health and weapon type. They also have a limited use special attack that can clear the screen of enemies. At the end of each level the hero jumps inside a giant robot and engages in a one-on-one duel with the boss of that level. 

The game features four difficulty levels (2 hidden),  a password system, and a "Battle mode" in which the player can practice fighting against any of the bosses.

		<desc>Moero TwinBee can be played by up to three player simultaneously: the first two players control TwinBee and WinBee (the ships from the previous game) using the standard Famicom controllers, whereas the third player controls GwinBee (a green ship) by connecting an additional controller into the console's expansion port. Unlike the original TwinBee, which only featured vertical-scrolling stages, Stinger adds side-scrolling stages to the mix as well. There are seven stages in the game. Stage 1, 3, and 7 are side-scrolling stages, while the rest are vertical-scrolling stages. The controls remain the same between the two styles of gameplay, with the only difference being that in the side-scrolling segments, the A button shoots hearts over the ship instead of dropping bombs into the ground like the vertical-scrolling segments, which helps the player keep the power-up bells afloat in the side-scrolling stages.</desc>

Kakuto Densetsu is another 2d side scrolling beat'em up in Nekketsu High series, featuring the same gameplay which involves beating up your enemies in side scrolling levels with a combination of punches, kicks and special moves. The differences in this title however, are that the entire game is laid out as 2-on-2 tournament fights in non-scrolling arenas in which your team must come up on the winning end and advance to the next round. You can play with good old Kunio or create your own character and advance his stats as he goes along in standard Nekketsu High fashion, and you can play alone with an AI-controlled partner or with a friend (you can also go for a 4-player battle royale in the Vs mode). 

Backgrounds have a major role in the fights, with several hazard zones and unique features, and the game also encourages teamwork as many special moves can be unlocked only by combining both of your characters (depending on their compatibility)

		<desc>Emoyan no 10-bai Pro Yakyuu ("Emoyan's Tenfold Pro Baseball") is a baseball sim for the NES produced by Hect. It features the name and likeness of former pitcher Takenori "Emoyan" Emoto, who by 1989 had already retired from baseball but continued to work as a commentator and author of books on the sport, before eventually going into politics in the '90s. One such book, titled "How To Make Watching Pro Baseball Ten Times More Fun," is where this game derives its name. Besides Emoyan, the game uses fictional players and team names.

The game has a heavier sim aspect than most baseball sims for the Famicom, with players choosing a spot on a grid to both bat and pitch towards, the idea being to predict the ball's movement or the batter's likelihood of reaching it. Fielding is performed automatically.</desc>

One day, before going to sleep, they notice a strange creature outside: it looks like a pink-white cat (Final Fantasy fans would immediately say: a moogle!), but talks like a human being. Before the mysterious creature disappears, it says only a short sentence: "Children! Find the Time Crown!". Without understanding what he meant by this, but realizing it must be something important, the two young heroes embark the next day on a dangerous journey - the quest for the power of the crown!

"Erika &amp; Satoru" plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, although you can also move on the overworld, visiting locations by standing on them and pressing the A button. Upon visiting a location, you can interact with characters and objects you view from first-person perspective by selecting icons located in the corner of the screen: talk to characters, examine, manipulate items, etc. The unusual part is that you control two characters: you can (and should) switch between them and sometimes work together in order to fulfil your quest. There is also a two-players mode, where Erika and Satoru cooperate while being controlled each one by a different player.</desc>

		<desc>Famista '89: Kaimaku Ban!! (roughly "Opening Game Edition") is a baseball sim from Namco, and marks the first occasion where the Family Stadium game series would officially shorten its name to "Famista" rather than the longer "Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium" brand it had carried previously.

As with all previous Family Stadium sequels, Famista maintains the series' trademark "chibi" look and baseball mechanics while updating the rosters for the current year (in this case, 1989).</desc>

		<desc>Hana no Star Kaidou (which can be loosely translated as "Blossoming Star Highway") is an action game for the Famicom that was developed and published by Victor Musical Industries in 1987. It is about two musicians who dream of obtaining a recording contract and becoming big stars. The player must control both Moero and Goro on the screen at one time. They run, jump, and attack simultaneously. Each one has their own life count, and the game is over as soon as one of them loses all of their lives. Because of the unituitive controls, and unforgiving game mechanics, this game is considered quite difficult and generally not fun to play.</desc>

		<name>Makai Island</name>
		<desc>Higemaru Makaijima (Makaijima Nanatsu no Shima Daibouken, lit. Hell Island: Great Adventure of 7 Islands) is an action-adventure game developed for the Famicom and MSX home computer, and released by Capcom in 1987. It is a sequel to a 1984 arcade game developed by Capcom known as Pirate Ship Higemaru. Neither the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan, although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it was to be renamed "Makai Island".
In Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications.
Once Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key. The island exploration sections are extremely reminiscent of dungeon exploration aspects of The Legend of Zelda, to which the game is often compared to.</desc>

There are a few pitfalls to avoid such as quicksand and sharks. There are also new traps (hidden pits, napalm, snares and a pistol) and hand-to-hand combat is done with swords instead of clubs.

There are seven difficulty levels which affect how much time will elapse before the volcano erupts and the size of the playing area.</desc>

		<name>Jj - Tobidase Daisakusen Part 2</name>
		<desc>JJ is an action game developed and published by Square for the Famicom in 1987. In English, it is sometimes referred to by its long form, Jumpin' Jack, or by its subtitle, Tobidase Daisakusen Part II. The game was only released in Japan. The sequel to Tobidase Daisakusen (known in North America as 3-D WorldRunner), JJ is a typical scrolling shooter, but it incorporates a third-person view, where the camera angle is positioned behind the main character. As in the previous title, the main character Jack must travel through various worlds, armed with his laser cannon and jumping ability, to defeat the serpentbeasts who have overrun the planets. JJ was the last game by Square to utilize the "3D mode" and 3D glasses, and was Square's last work before the inception of the popular Final Fantasy franchise. The soundtrack of JJ consists of eight tracks, and all of them are either remixed or reused from the game's prequel, 3-D WorldRunner. The game was scored by Nobuo Uematsu, and is Uematsu's 16th work of video game music composition.</desc>

		<name>Ganso Saiyuuki - Super Monkey Daibouken</name>
		<desc>This game is based on the Chinese novel Journey to the West. The goal of the game is to survive the long and arduous journey from China to India.

Players take control of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, as he helps guide Xuanzang, a Buddhist monk, on his quest to collect some Buddhist sutras. Xuanzang also rides a horse who is actually a dragon prince. Along the way, players will also join up with other guardians to add to their party.

In the game, players go on a journey across an overworld map. Players have to find certain locations or buildings in order to move along in their adventure. Some buildings will lead the player into a short side-scrolling action stage where the player has to defeat an onslaught of enemies. Also, players have to be on a lookout for spots where they can pick up food and drink so they don't starve or die of thirst on their lengthy journey.

Since the game lacks a proper save feature, the player will occasionally be given a code input to put in at the game's title screen, so the player can continue the game from where the code input was given.</desc>

		<desc>The legend of Kaguya-hime is one of the most popular stories in Japanese mythology. Once upon a time, an old man went to the forest to cut some bamboo, and found a little baby girl. He took her to his house and named her Kaguya-hime. She grew up there, and soon became the most beautiful girl of Japan. Many young men, including the son of the emperor himself, tried to conquer her heart, but for no avail. One day Kaguya-hime confessed she was a moon angel, and returned back to the moon. In this game, you control the son of the emperor, and you'll do your best to reach Kaguya-hime and to protect her. You must overcome various obstacles and meet characters from Japanese folklore.

The game is a traditional Japanese adventure: all the actions are performed by selecting commands from the menu, including moving from location to location. You view the locations from first-person perspective, but there are also parts where you navigate your character from a  top-down view. Beside the usual adventure commands such as "look", "take", or "use" (an inventory item) there are some more original actions available under "extras", such as "kiss", "attack", and even "undress".</desc>

		<name>Musashi No Ken - Tadaima Shugyou Chuu</name>
		<desc>Musashi no Ken - Tadaima Shugyou Chuu (lit. "Sword of Musashi - Now in the Middle of Training") is based on a Japanese sports manga series written and illustrated by Motoka Murakami that focuses on kendo, simply titled Musashi no Ken. The gameplay and design in the one-on-one fighting parts resemble Taito's other fighting game, Great Swordsman, especially its kendo mode.
The game's plot is about the son of two Kendo champions named Musashi. He strives to become as great at Kendo as his parents. The entire story centers around the world of Kendo and its up-and-coming competitors. The anime is broken up into two parts. The first part follows Musashi's early years in grade school while the second part follows his high school years. In the first episode, Musashi befriends an Akita puppy who is by his side throughout the series.
There are two different modes: single player and two player VS. mode. On single player mode, the player depicts Musashi in the middle of his training. He must run through several obstacle courses collecting swords and other items along the way. At the same time, his pet Akita will be running the course behind him. Musashi must not fall too far behind his dog. After completing three courses, Musashi will be entered into a 2D weapon-based versus fighting-style Kendo tournament. He must defeat five competitors to win the tournament. The swords that Musashi collects during the obstacle courses provide him with access to special strike moves if he has collected enough. If the player succeeds in winning, the game will continue from the beginning at a higher level of difficulty. After winning the championship a second time, the game is over.
On two player vs. mode, each player selects from a roster of competitors, and selects them secretly by pressing different inputs on the control pad. The selections are revealed once five selections have been made. Each player then squares off in a Kendo match with each of their selections. Whoever gets three or more victories wins the game.</desc>

The game is played as a side-scrolling beat 'em up, but with the added challenge of having to find the exit for the maze-like stages besides beating all the baddies. Goemon fights using his smoking pipe, but he can upgrade his weapon with power-ups found in the game or bought at several shops using the money collected from fallen enemies à la River City Ransom. Features hot-seat alternating 2 player gameplay.

The gameplay is simple and similar to many other baseball games released on the NES, with five ways to play. You can play a versus mode against either the computer or a partner, take a team through a season of between 30 and 130 games in hopes of winning the pennant, play a multiplayer tournament, or play a home run derby and try to knock as many balls as you can out of the park. There's also an edit mode where you can configure your team for the Pennant Mode, and a "Watch" mode where you can watch a CPU-controlled match.

Each of the sixteen teams, just like actual baseball teams, have strengths and weaknesses. Seven of the teams also have designated hitters, who replace pitchers when it's their turn at bat. All teams also have eight starters, who can be switched out at any point (but cannot be switched back). The teams can play in either one of four stadiums, which all are basically the same.</desc>

However, she didn't come back, and so Yanchamaru must make his way through the oddly-aggressive attractions to find and rescue the princess!

Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2 is the sequel to Kid Niki, and once again stars the big-headed, sword-spinning, headband-sporting fighter Yanchamaru. Each stage is based around a theme, such as a world built from cakes and a world built from volcanoes, and each is filled with animatronic enemies, with a boss at the end.

		<name>Gegege No Kitarou 2 - Youkai Gundan No Chousen</name>
		<desc>Gegege no Kitarou 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen (Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Yokai Army) is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong. The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and yÅkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller. 

Gegege no Kitarou 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points. 

The map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.</desc>

		<desc>This strategy game is somewhat similar to the better-known Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and other historical simulation games by the same company, but also differs from them by having much less complex diplomacy options and focusing the gameplay on navigation and individual encounters. Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion. The grids can be occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their outcome depends on the characters' statistics.</desc>

		<desc>In Amagon, your mission is to investigate a dangerous, monster-infested island.  As Amagon, you begin the game with only a machine gun and a limited amount of ammo to protect yourself from the inhabitants of the island. Gameplay is an arcade style platform game with six levels, each with a variety of creatures and a large boss at the end. When you destroy an enemy, a power up will sometimes be left behind. Collecting these can give you extra points, an extra life, more ammo, or a mega key. If you have enough points and collect a mega key, you then have the ability to transform into Megagon. In this form, you are larger in size, can jump further, and have increased strength. You start the transformation with an amount of mega points; each time a creature injures you, points are lost. When all of the mega points are gone you will transform back into your normal size.</desc>

It is the first of the series of baseball games that was informally known as "Harisuta", which saw four games published for the Famicom, and two more for the Super Famicom. The starting entry contains 13 teams, 12 of which are modeled after real Japanese teams, while a 13th team (the I team) consists of a team of women players who represent various idols or models who were popular at the time. The game features a single player mode against the computer, a head-to-head mode for two players, or a home run mode where you compete to see who can hit the most home runs. Before the end of 1988, a version of the same game was released with an updated player roster, under the title Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium '88 Senshuu Shin Data.</desc>

		<name>Ushio To Tora - Shinen No Daiyou</name>
		<desc>Based on the animé series Ushio &amp; Tora, this game tells the story of a boy named Ushio. He lives in a modern-day Tokyo with his father, but his family line stretches back to the samurai days of Japan. Five hundred years ago a demon was terrorizing the land. Ushio's ancestor, wielding a magical spear from China, managed to bind the monster to a rock with an artifact. Unable to kill the demon, he built a temple around it and stayed there as a monk in order to make sure it won't escape. Ushio finds the demon still tied to the rock in the basement of one of the temple buildings. Unfortunately, by breaking the seal on the doors to the basement, Ushio has released the demon's evil energy, which attracts other monsters. Ushio calls the demon Tora, because it reminds him of a tiger (Tora is Japanese for tiger). Tora has to stick with Ushio, because he holds the magical spear, and to help him to defeat his own evil will!

The game plays like a traditional console-style RPG, with turn-based battles, where Ushio uses his family magic, and Tora his demonic abilities. You explore Tokyo by moving Ushio around from top-down perspective, and inside houses and dungeons the view switches to first-person, like in early "interactive fiction" adventures.

Ushio to Tora: Shinen no Daiyo is a Japan-only release and is not the same game as the SNES action title "Ushio &amp; Tora".</desc>

		<desc>In the far future, the apocalypse has come and gone. Now people leave peacefully in rural cities making the best of the advanced technology that survives and trying to win back the world day by day. Ark City, the crown jewel of technological advances, has managed to put back into operation a super computer capable of taking control of every aspect of civilization, right down to weather and mind control. This does not bode well for the people of the world, so you as an ESP-gifted warrior take it upon yourself to journey to Ark City and get rid of this threat.

Hoshi wo Miru Hito is a classic NES-era RPG, in which you navigate your party (composed of you and 3 other ESP-wielding heroes you can find) in a top-down world map, chat with NPCs in towns, buy weapons and armor, and finally journey into dungeons to gain clues that help you in your journey.

Combat whisks you away from the top-down perspective to a battle view in which you see your opponents and heroes in a first-person perspective, and assign actions in turns, with the ESP powers taking the place of magic spells.</desc>

The game is fronted by Matsumoto Tooru, a nationally well-known financial adviser who is often considered to have an expansive knowledge of the Japanese stock market. The game also features the song "The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin.

Though it focused on unusually complex subject matter for a video game, it sold enough copies to inspire a sequel that was released the following year.</desc>

Apart from different/new level design, there are other notable changes: Holding down the fire button let's Turrican run, there is no time limit to levels anymore, energy wheel usage is limitless and the shield isn't time based anymore, but can sustain a certain number of hits.</desc>

It is a heavily localized version of the Japanese game Dragon Ball: Shenron no Nazo (translated to Dragon Ball: Mystery of the Dragon God), originally released on November 27, 1986. Although some of the European releases retain the Dragon Ball assets (under the title Dragon Ball), the North American release removes most references to the franchise. The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).</desc>
