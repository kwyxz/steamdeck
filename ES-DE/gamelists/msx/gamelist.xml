		<name>10 Yard Fight</name>
		<desc>The main idea of this game is that players take control of a football team and have the task of trying to score a touchdown before the clock runs out.

Players start out as a high school team. Games consists of two halves. One touchdown must be scored before time runs out in each half or the game is lost. After a touchdown is scored, the half ends and the 2nd half of the game starts. If the player scores in both halves, they win the game, and then move on to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty levels after high school go from college, pro, then to super. The higher the difficulty, the less amount of time is given for a player to score a touchdown.

Since the game is concerned with scoring touchdowns, in the 1 player game the player is always on offense. Players can score points for completing passes and for gaining yards by either rushing or passing. Scoring a touchdown also adds to the players score, as does any remaining time on the clock after the touchdown is scored. Also after a touchdown, the player can add on to their score by kicking an extra point. 

Other rules on the field include getting a 1st down to add time to the clock. If the player throws an interception or go four downs without getting a 1st down, they are penalized yards.


In a 2 player game, the second player plays defense until it's their turn to play offense.</desc>

The player controls a railroad company CEO in the end of the nineteenth century, who was entrusted by the president of an unnamed country to build a railroad that reaches its Western coast. The game is played in real time, with a day/night cycle and a game world that changes regardless of the player's actions. Compared to its more widely known sequels, A Ressha de Ikou has a rather simple gameplay that is confined to building tracks for just one train line, the titular A-train. A report is generated that shows how well the player is doing in his/her competition against other networks.</desc>

		<name>Adven' Chuta!</name>
		<desc>Taking its title from the English word "adventure" and the squeak of a mouse; "chu", Adven'chuta is an old school adventure game, not far from Atari's old Adventure.

As a mouse, you must get around a dungeon populated by dangerous frogs and spiders. There are jars which may contain both treasures and danger, and which block the way. You have an inventory, but it can only contain one item at any time. Take care in what you pick up and leave behind. Juggling the inventory becomes a basic skill since items will block the narrow passages of the dungeon. Basic items are keys, for opening the door to the next dungeon, as well as cheese, which is good for the adventuring mouse's stamina. The dungeon must be completed within a set time or it's game over.

Control the mouse with the cursor keys, and use the following keys to issue commands:

B: Crush jar
T: Take item
O: Open door
P: Leave item behind
E: Eat cheese
K: Kick frog</desc>

Unlike Aleste 1, you are not controlling a spaceship, but instead you're controlling a robot. However, like Aleste, you can shoot enemies, enemies can shoot you, collect power ups, and defeat bosses at the end of a level. However, new to this game is the ability to jump over holes in the ground. This adds a new challenge to the game. In some levels, there are even obstacles like cars that you have to avoid. Power ups range from one that clones yourself and can fire lasers with you, one that replaces your default laser with shurikens. One replaces your default weapon and instead shoots red targets that go in a zig-zag. This laser has a possiblity of shooting enemies. The kinds of power-ups are marked by the color of their box-containers and the Japanese letter on them.</desc>

Armed with only a basic gun at first, she faces facehuggers that come out of alien eggs. After having dispatched a face hugger, the egg may be shot to reveal an item. Items may be hand grenades, stronger guns or wing items which make her jump longer. For some reason, the planet is infested not only with aliens and their offspring, but also with snakes. After clearing the surface level, Ripley enters a complex where the first boss, a giant, full-grown alien resides. The following level takes place within the complex.</desc>

Aquattack is an action game with four levels which partly have varying gameplay mechanics. In level one and two, the player mans a motor boat which needs to travel a certain distance from left to right. Of course there is a lot of enemy opposition which needs to be avoided. Some enemies can be shot while others are out of reach. Fuel is limited and needs to replenished by collecting refreshments dropped by allied planes. Level three is similar; the player uses a hang glider now. There are different enemies to fight and no fuel to collect. In level four, there is a guarded energy field to cross in order to bring four bombs to the other side. However, only one bomb can be transported at once and there is a time limit.

After beating all four levels, they loop with more difficult enemies and faster playing speed.  The player can take nine hits and the overall goal is to earn as many points as possible before the unavoidable final death occurs.</desc>

		<desc>Arctic is an action puzzle game that describes itself as "active rail playing". Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage's features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

		<name>Backgammon</name>
		<desc>This is the game backgammon and its variant, acey deucey. For backgammon, the standard rules are used. As they are long and complex, if you want to see those rules, look in this manual.

Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For Atari, this is the variation used here:

All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice.

No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar.

A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he wants, after making the 1-2 move.

After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.

If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another doublet.

Difficulty switches

Right:

A=computer rolls dice for you

B=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers

Left:

A=computer sets up the board for you

B=you can set the pieces where you want them.

Game variations

Games 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player

Games 2, 4, 6, and 8 are two player

		<name>Back To The Future</name>
		<desc>In Back to the Future, 80s teen Marty McFly is mistakenly send 30 years into the past where he disrupts his own parents from meeting. Faced with extinction at the hands of a temporal paradox, Marty must find a way to reunite his future parents and make it back to his own time.

LJN's game differs completely from the computer versions, and plays as a literal race against time broken up by brief arcade minigames. In the main game, the player controls Marty in an overhead view as he runs down the streets of 1950s Hill Valley.  A collection of period-appropriate bad guys block his path, including bullies, hula hoop girls, bumblebees, and park benches.  The camera scrolls forward at a fixed speed, so the player must keep Marty on the move and away from obstacles. Hitting one causes Marty to fall and lose a life. The player must also collect clocks scattered on the street to stop Marty's photograph from fading away.  If it fades completely, Marty is erased from existence.

Street running sections lead to three minigames. In these, Marty must sling milkshakes at oncoming bullies, deflect kisses (shown as hearts) from his mother, and collect notes to rock out on stage at the high school dance. The final stage resembles the street sections, as the player must control the DeLorean time machine and collect enough energy to travel through time (shown as lightning bolts instead of clocks).</desc>

		<path>./Balance (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Balance</name>
		<desc>This German game of dexterity delivers what the title promises. Balance is a lesson in applied gravity: guide a ball to one or more targets by tilting the plane it sits on, much like in those little plastic toys that drive you insane. A simple premise made challenging by tricky, maze-like level layouts that go beyond the "A to B" routine, but require you to touch a certain number of target tiles in no particular order. You must reach all targets in limited time, or else you have to start over. If the ball falls off the edge, one of ten lives is lost. Special fields such as jumpers, accelerators or crumbling tiles test your reflexes; some levels even rotate.

Balance uses vector graphics to draw flat, untextured fields on which the ball rolls. The plane is tilted with the mouse. Every few levels, you get a password to jump directly to that map. Even so, Balance is extremely difficult and only recommended for players with *a lot* of patience.</desc>

		<desc>Banana is a puzzle game based on the Mole Mole games, where you have to navigate a mole through various levels, making it to the exit. The task is not as simple as it sounds. First, the mole cannot jump or climb up unless there is a ladder nearby. So you have to plan your route ahead, otherwise you can get stuck at the bottom. Second, boulders will fall and block your way. And third, you have a wife. You should first find her, and then lead her securely to the exit. The wife will sometimes make things harder, forcing you to find alternate ways to the exit. But sometimes she'll also be helpful, pushing away boulders and clearing the road for you. 

On every level, there is also various food scattered around, primarily bananas. You'll be able to complete a level if you have gathered enough of those fruits. You'll also gain superpowers from bananas that will allow you to skip level sections that you find too difficult. The entire game is played only with the four directional buttons. There are no enemies and you cannot die - although you can get irrevocably stuck, in which case you'll have to restart a level.</desc>

		<name>Bank Panic</name>
		<desc>As a gunslinger, it's your job to protect a bank from bandits while taking care not to shoot innocent customers. The bank has 12 doors in front of 12 teller windows, with only three doors visible at a time. Shooting is done simply by pressing one of the three buttons to shoot the left, middle or right door. The player can move his viewpoint left and right to reveal new doors. People only appear behind the doors that are currently visible on screen, except for the rare outlaws who will pop up to steal a cash deposit from a teller window the player isn't watching. Indicators at the top of the screen show how much time it will take before someone will show up at a door. 

If a bandit appears behind a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot him before he shoots you. If you shoot him too early (i.e. before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair and gives very little score, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives. Sometimes a bandit will stick dynamite on one of the doors. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. If you take too long, the bomb explodes (even if it's offscreen) and you lose a life. 

If you're lucky, a customer will appear behind the door and deposit a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. Sometimes a bandit will suddenly take the customer hostage and replace them in the door. 

At other times, a cowboy will appear with a stack of hats. Shooting off all the hats before the door closes grants a cash deposit and a big score bonus. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there's more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll get three bags of gold coins. 

There are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person behind all 12 doors was able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get difficult the further you get. For example, in later rounds, a few bandits will block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless of what round you're on, there is a time limit.</desc>

		<desc>The TurboGrafx-16 version of Batman: The Video Game is a top-down maze-like game, somewhat similar to Pac-Man or Bomberman.

The game consists of five stages based on the movie: the Streets of Gotham, Flugelheim Museum, AXIS Chemical Factory, the Parade and the Cathedral, where Batman finally faces the Joker. The first four stages are divided into 12 sub-stages or mazes. Each main level has its own objective, which basically consists of finding items in the mazes: collecting "smilex" components in the streets of Gotham, cleaning paintings at the museum, planting bombs at the factory and cutting off the ropes of Joker's balloons at the parade. Before each level, a cutscene with scenes from the movie is displayed.

Batman can attack his enemies with his Batarang. Through the levels, he will collect items which will upgrade his speed and give his Batarang a longer range and multiple shots.</desc>

The game presents itself as a standard chop-socky side-scroller, as you pummel apes and flamingos and other woodland creatures. It's not immediately apparent, but the game world is quite large and complex, reportedly containing over 400 screens. The entire world is laid out on a grid, with several horizontal paths that are positioned parallel to each other. As you run across the levels, you'll find arrows that represent places where you can hop onto other areas.</desc>

The player's mission is to storm the island and recapture it. This takes place over the course of six different sequences. The first sequence is Aerial Reconnaissance, where the fleet must be moved directly past the enemy or into a hidden passage to trigger another, optional stage. In this Hidden Passage sequence, the player will have to maneuver around mines and torpedoes. Successfully completing it gives a surprise advantage in the following General Quarters sequence, where the player controls anti-aircraft guns shooting down enemy aircraft.

The next sequence is named Battle Stations and the player must aim and fire heavy guns to hit enemy ships before they inflict too much damage and eventually sink the player's own vessels.  Following this battle, the fleet must be maneuvered to the beach. 
Upon reaching the Beach-Head level, tanks roll out and the player must keep these safe from enemy fire and obstacles while driving. In the Final Battle sequence, the Dictator is holed up in the fortress of Kuhn-Lin and 10 different targets on the fortress must be fired upon to destroy it.

The port for C16 and Plus/4 computers only contains the General Quarters, Battle Stations and Final Battle sequences.</desc>

Enemies such as spiders will put web on your way or attack you. You can kill them for points. There are various power-ups that appear randomly on the levels.

The Black Onyx is one of the first traditional role-playing games made by a Japanese company. It is similar in gameplay to early Wizardry and Ultima games with killing monsters and exploring dungeons, with dark, realistic visuals. The player creates a party (up to five members) and explores a maze-like 3D dungeon, fighting random enemies on the way. The heroes also meet adventurers who can be convinced to join the party.

In this strategy game, your goal sounds simple – just walk a distance of 600 meters and defeat king Ogreth. But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand.</desc>

While it is often overlooked, it is a distinct title and the first entry in the Bomberman series. The MSX and ZX Spectrum versions were localized in Europe as Eric and the Floaters.</desc>

		<name>Bomber Man Special</name>
		<desc>Bomberman was a robot in a bomb making factory who longed for his freedom. Rumors circulated that escaping to the surface would allow the robot to become human. Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.

The first of the Bomberman series, Bomberman is a single-player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, the player only has a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (four directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. The goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</desc>

		<desc>Bosconian is a space shooter. It's your job to destroy enormous enemy battle stations scattered throughout the galaxy, which is filled with meteors and space mines. You can either do this by destroying one by one their outer structures or with a single shot in their core. They are heavily defended however by guns, fighters and (in later levels) missiles. Destroying all battle stations, with the help of your radar, will bring you to the next level. 

Often the enemy will try to destroy you by launching attack waves. Keep your eyes out for the enemy spy ship, if it escapes your fire, you are really in for it.

Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.

There are 16 levels to be completed and five different skill levels available, which affect the number of jewels which must be collected and the time limit.</desc>

		<path>./Break In (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Break In</name>
		<desc>As the title implies, this is a game about breaking into banks, as well as a Break-Out clone.

Each level is a bank, consisting of several rooms. You can only leave a room after your ball hits a key. As a burgler, you are symbolised by a pair of eyes, on top of which a paddle rests. Similarly to Woody Pop, parts of the bottom of the screen is covered up, so that you need not guard the ball as much as in other games. Unlike most Break-Out clones, you can move freely over the entire screen so as to hit the ball at the perfect spot. If you miss the ball and it passes through the void at the bottom, it falls back into the earlier rooms, just like in the Amiga classic, Poing. If you catch it there, you can send it back to the room your were in. In the last room of each bank, you should hit the money that is in there, before you hit the square with a calculator, which will calculate your score for that bank. Later vaults feature a bell which must not be hit, or it will wake a guardian that will hunt you across the screen.

As in all post-Arkanoids, powerups are available, in the shape of a circle that bounces across the screen, all the while changing colours. Depending on which colour it is when you pick it up with your paddle, you get one bonus out of a range which corresponds to the basics of most games in the genre, such as wider paddle, sticky paddle, multiball and firepower.</desc>

		<name>Bruce Lee</name>
		<desc>The late martial arts hero features in this platform game, with the aim of reaching a wizard in an underground lair, defeat of whom can offer him untold wealth. 

In each area you must collect the many strategically-placed lanterns before exiting through the newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders.  There are 20 areas to be completed.

On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. The game also allows a second player to take control of Yamo.

There are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge and exploding bushes for example.</desc>

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</desc>

		<desc>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. 

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step over every burger ingredient. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also "bump" any other ingredient below it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud that will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.

Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.</desc>

In some levels the arena can contain a ramp, which can be used to jump on other cars or a pond in the middle in which you can try to push the other cars to take them out of the competition.

All this has to be done before you run out of fuel. If any fuel left then you'll receive bonus points.</desc>

		<desc>Pachinko UFO is a simulator of the popular Japanese gambling pastime of pachinko with added computerised action elements. The main screen resembles a typical pachinko unit with pins for balls to bounce on, spinners for balls to put in motion, and baskets for them to land in. The baskets open and close, and so does the big feature in the middle of the screen, an airplane or spaceship with an integrated fruit-machine like counter. When a score specified by the counters is reached, the game changes to a shooter sequence, where the pachinko balls must be used to shoot down aliens. After that, the game continues to the next table.

The control mechanism is similar to golf games, in that the longer you press the button, the more power is given to the ball ejection mechanism. This makes for an experience unlike a real pachinko machine, where the perfect power of the ejector is reached by setting a dial at the right angle, after which it can be locked at that angle. In Pachinko UFO, you must hit a perfect timing instead.

The Monstas themselves hatch from eggs hanging from the ceilings and the Mightas push a rock that is used as the game's timer. The Monsta eggs have three phases:  if it's blue, it's completely harmless, if it's yellow it will pop within 10 seconds and if an egg turns red it will pop almost immediately.

Chack'n uses bombs to blow up the Monstas and their eggs and he also uses them to release the captured hearts from their cages. When the heart is released, it will fly up and destroy the separator block and reveal the exit to the level.

Most versions of the game contain 14 levels to play through, however the Famicom version only includes 9.</desc>

		<desc>The Choro Q video game is based on Takara's Choro Q cars (also known as Penny Racers). In each level of this platform game you - a Choro Q car - have to build two other cars. The components from which a car must be built are chassis, engine and coachwork, what of course must occur in the correct order. During your attempt to build cars you are pursued by hostile cars and tanks. When the first car is assembled entirely it then will change into a coin. Collecting that coin gives you temporarily invulnerability, so you can chase the hostile cars and tanks for bonuses. Don't drive too fast or you will fall from the platform or crash into the wall.</desc>

The goal is to trap your opponent's pieces between yours, turning them into your pieces. When there are no free spaces left, whoever has the most pieces wins.</desc>

		<desc>The subtitle "The moving puzzle game" should be interpreted literally; this is a puzzle game where the picture on the puzzle pieces are constantly animated. This can make piecing together the pieces quite difficult, or at least call for strategies not used in conventional puzzles.

There are ten puzzles to choose from, and these can be divided into anything from 2x2 to 12x8 pieces. The pieces are not only scattered, they may also be turned upside down. 

As you play the puzzle, your score starts to count down, and the rate of the countdown is heightened when you execute moves, turn the pieces or use the special features which will reveal a glimpse of the finished puzzle, automatically lay out pieces, or halt the animation. If the score reaches zero, the game is over.</desc>

The player controls a lone character, a young man whose father sent him on a mission to defeat the evil monster Crimson before passing away. Exploration is done in an overhead fashion, and is divided into world map and hostile areas, which are usually maze-like and contain one or more dungeons each. In towns the hero can buy weapons, armor, and items, as well as rest in inns.

Enemies appear randomly, and the battles are turn-based. The player character can either attack, defend, or use an item. Combat is viewed from a first-person perspective. Unlike Dragon Quest, there are no random encounters on the world map. Exploration is non-linear, i.e. the player has access to many areas of the map from the beginning of the game.</desc>

When the time comes, you will have to bomb the target manually. So, get ready to unload the cargo and give them hell!</desc>

		<desc>The game takes place within a gigantic spaceship which has virtually infinite capacity because of its ability to manipulate time and space. The player must deal with enigmatic creatures called EVOL, which consist only of pure energy and need to keep themselves in capsules in order to maintain their existence in the world.
All of the characters in the game are designed to resemble microscopic organisms, both in their appearance and their quick, tricky movements. The player's ship undergoes over 10 types of transformations throughout the game, each with offensive and defensive maneuvers specific to their design. The sound effects used are minimal, but different types of sounds are used according to the type of shots or their speed. A sound resembling a long scream results when the player's ship is hit and returns to its weakest evolutionary state. The game's designer, graphic designer, and music composer, Tomo Furukawa, would go on to become the vocalist of the band Guniw Tools.The game controls like a regular shoot-'em-up: A and C shoot bullets, B drops bombs; there is rapidfire. However, unlike regular shoot-'em-ups where weapons are upgraded through powerups, your ship "evolves" to survive situations and get past obstacles. Evolution occurs with the Evol (small faces with an E on them) and B-Evol (darker Evols). Each pickup adds a new evolution state to the list. After a particular amount of time, one evolution wears off and the next evolution is chosen. The DNA powerup does provide a more permanent weapon upgrade, but will merely just make the existing weapons stronger. You can hold up to nine DNA powerups.</desc>

		<desc>Decathlon is a 1-2 player sports game combining ten athletics track and field events.
The game can be played as single events or in a full 10 event competition against the computer or/and a human opponent.

The competing events in the game are the normal: 100m sprint race, 400m dash, 1500m run,
110m hurdles, long jump, high jump, pole vault, shot put, discus throw and javelin throw.

Players can select their country (and the opponents) from eight predefined: UK, France, Germany, Austria, USA, Canada, Japan, Taiwan.
The competitors names are not changeable, e.g. 'Tommy' will always compete for the UK.

Only two players (human or computer) compete against each other in every event, so even if in the 1500m run four characters are running on the track; the two extras are just filling out the field, creating a tripping hazard for the two actual competitors.

Each character has a stamina/power that affects his performance, so the player has to keep within the avatars limits, or he gets too tired.

After a single race, the player gets the option of trying again, or ending the event.

In a full decathlon, a points table is filled in as the events progress.</desc>

A hero claiming to be the descendant of the previous hero Raru appears in the town of Dorl, and sets on exploring a tower in order to defeat Ruu.

The game consists of an eight level tower, four of which are underground, while the others are above ground, the underground levels having a higher difficulty than the latter. The game plays like its predecessor, the player exploring the tower in a first-person view, fighting monsters and improving the hero's skills along the way. When the hero levels up, he gains points to be attributed to his different stats rather than having them distributed automatically. When the hero's level is significantly higher than that of the monsters on the level, random battles are suspended; only the battles triggered by stepping on specific spaces have to be fought. The game has two endings, one being a secret good ending.</desc>

(if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.

		<desc>Originating in the arcades, Dragon Buster is an action platform game composed out of several large levels, each one containing various stages: a cave, a tower, a castle, etc. The player's goal in every level is to reach the final stage where the protagonist faces the level boss. There are often several ways to reach the final stages, and not all stages are necessary to visit. Equipped with a sword, the player character moves through platform stages, clearing them of diverse monsters, collecting power-ups and trying to stay in good health until the level boss, since it is impossible to heal between the stages. The hero's life meter (called "vitality" in the game) is the first introduction of such a feature to action games.</desc>

		<path>./Dragon Slayer (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Dragon Slayer</name>
		<desc>Dragon Slayer is commonly considered one of the progenitors of the action RPG genre. The premise is similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a knight who must fight his way through large overhead maze-like dungeons. Unlike roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must approach the monster and "bump" into it in order to inflict damage, at the same time trying to avoid its blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the knight if he attempts to escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is randomized.
The player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Slayer II - Xanadu</name>
		<desc>Xanadu was the name of the summer capital of the Mongolian-ruled Yuan Dynasty in 13th century China. The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.

Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply "bumping" into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.

Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.

Money can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a "karma" system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many "good" enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Slayer IV - Drasle Family</name>
		<desc>Long ago, an evil dragon named Keela was imprisoned inside a magical dungeon. However time has passed and the magic that sealed the dragon away is weakening. The Drasle family decides that it's time to destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.
The player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.

The object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-restoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.</desc>

In Romancia: Dragon Slayer Jr., you are a young warrior whom the king sends on a mission to rescue a lost princess. You must leave the town and enter the dreadful monster-infested catacombs in order to complete your quest.

The game is a departure from Dragon Slayer RPG-oriented gameplay style. It tends more towards medieval-themed platformer action. The hero has hit points, can buy items and weapons, use magic, and stay in inns to recover health. However, instead of receiving experience points and becoming stronger, you simply must attack quicker (by bumping into your opponent on platform levels) and jump higher.</desc>

		<desc>Druid is an action game inspired by the arcade hit Gauntlet. As the eponymous hero, your job is to destroy four magic skulls hidden over eight levels. 

The game is presented in a top-down view. The druid walks around the terrain seeking out the staircase that leads to the next level. On the way, he is harassed by hordes of monsters that come out of every direction and attack him, decreasing his health. To defend himself, the druid can use the spells of water, fire or electricity to toss projectiles. However, these magical weapons have limited ammo. 

The druid also has three other magical spells at his disposal - an invisibility spell which prevents the monsters from automatically approaching him, a golem spell which summons a helpful golem (which can be controlled by a second player), and a skull spell which destroys all on-screen enemies. The druid also carries around keys which open locked doors. But all these have very limited supplies. 

On his way, the druid finds many shops. Each such shop contains some keys or charges for the druid's spells, but the druid can only pick one item from each shop. 

The druid can also come across a pentagram on the ground which will restore his lost health. </desc>

The gameplay is reminiscent of the 3D dungeon crawl type of role-playing games popularized by Wizardry and The Bard's Tale.  However, unlike these games, Dungeon Master features real-time combat, which requires the player to click on the opponent in order to execute an attack. Another notable aspect of the game is its growth system: instead of gathering experience points and leveling up, characters improve by repeatedly using the same action. Spellcasting involves selecting and combining symbols, which can be arranged as rune sequences. The game also allows the player to directly interact with objects in the game world through a point-and-click interface.</desc>

You must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item.

Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them: shooting them with his gun, kicking them by jumping onto them, shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them and crushing them with an elevator.

Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.</desc>

You first get to buy a unit or two that you can place on your castle. You then move any unit you want to a neighbouring province. After that comes the magic phase, where you can cast spells to give your troops an advantage, like summoning a mighty white dragon that will participate in one fight before disappearing, or hinder those of your AI opponent, even forcibly moving one of his units to another province. The number of magic points available to you depends on the number of ruins you control.</desc>

It also features Konami's custom sound chip called Konami SCC (a five-channel chip that compliments the three-channel PSG chip of the MSX computer system, or in other words, a sound custom chip that brings five voices more to the three voices of the PSG sound chip on the system), and great MSX1 graphics to go with it. It was one of the first ROM on MSX with this sound feature. Together with its "3D" spinoff (F-1 Spirit: 3D Special), F-1 Spirit: The Way To Formula-1 was the most extended racing game Konami released for the MSX.</desc>

		<desc>Ring King is a boxing game in which the action in the ring is viewed in a 3D top-down view and a full range of moves is provided, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard.

Each punch weakens your opponent's strength which can slightly recover during a round break. A rain of well placed blows can produce a quick knockout, but normally you must hit your opponent many times before he goes down.

The game has three play modes. There is training mode to train your player before you enter a tournament. A ranking mode where you can select one of the three championships, Rookie, Japan and World. Each championship can be played at five difficulty levels. The third mode is the tournament mode. To reach the number one spot in the ranking or tournament mode you must train your boxer well.

Before you start you must create your character and set his initial abilities, strength, speed and stamina. Each won bout increases these abilities slightly. The abilities of your opponent and you are visible in the status bar at the top of the screen during the game. Strength is represented with a boxing glove, speed with a shoe and stamina with a dumb bell.

This game can be played by one player against the computer or by two players against each other. A password is given after each won bout and it enables you to continue with the next match in a tournament at a later time.</desc>

		<name>Fantasy Zone 2 - The Tears Of Opa-opa</name>
		<desc>In the past, the courageous hero Opa-Opa saved the Fantasy Zone from the invading Nenon forces, but his victory came at a price as he was forced to fight his own father who led the invasion. It is now Space Year 1432, 10 years after that battle, and the Nenon forces are once again spreading chaos through the Fantasy Zone. Opa-Opa must once again fly into the Fantasy Zone to rout the invasion. Similar to Defender, the player occupies a side-scrolling level that repeats indefinitely, and in which the player can freely travel left or right. Each zone contains several "bases" that serve as primary targets. New to the sequel are "warps" hidden behind certain bases that allow the player to travel between different zones. Each level has at least three zones, and when all of the bases have been cleared in all of the zones of a level, the player can travel through the warp to the boss. Boss fights do not allow for free travel as the main stages do, and force the player to face the boss or face a particular direction. Bosses are generally very large and change color to reflect damage taken. The final stage is a "boss rush" in which the player must fight a succession of previous bosses before fighting the final boss. There are two action buttons that correspond to two types of attacks, "fire" and "bomb". The fire attacks shoot horizontally, as in a typical shooter, and different variants can be purchased at shops. The bomb attacks are more powerful, and the basic bomb drops downward. Other variants have other behaviors and are limited in quantity. Shops, uncovered at key points, allow the player to purchase upgraded weapons, bombs, and speed, as well as extra lives.[8] Upgrades to Opa-Opa's speed (such as larger wings, or jet engines) are permanent as long as the player does not lose a life, but weapon upgrades are time-limited, and bombs limited in quantity. Items become increasingly expensive with subsequent purchases, encouraging the player to vary their purchases.</desc>

Octopuses, sharks, and a deadly maze of seaweed will get in your way and cause you to lose energy if caught! When you have located all of the trident pieces, the cage holding Neptina can be unlocked, but if you run out of energy first the game will be over.</desc>

The goal of the game seems to be to stop some kind of missile attack. At the beginning of the game you need to select two members of your team, out of five options available. Statistics of these members are presented during the opening credits of the game.

The gameplay is sluggish, and your team members take a fixed formation which is actually a hindrance to get past obstacles as they will not get out of formation and prevent you from moving forward. The enemies seem to be being spawned at random, as such it is critical to keep moving forward as fast as possible avoiding them as much as you can.</desc>

		<desc>The premise of Flicky is dramatically simple: the chick has to face a succession of fixed boards (which form an infinite loop around themselves) full of platforms. The other inhabitants of the board are a variable number of tiny chicks, a kitten called Tiger and an iguana called Iggy. The objective is of course to collect all the chicks and get them to the exit while avoiding Tiger and Iggy. Once taken under your wing, the chicks will follow you in single file. If Tiger or Iggy manage to hit one of the chicks, it will stop following you and you will have to retrieve it. If the two predators catch Flicky, they eat him, simple as that. The only way Flicky can get rid of his feline and reptilian pursuers is by picking up certain items lying around the levels and sending them into Tiger's vibrissae or Iggy's scales.</desc>

The game starts out on the streets of a city with nine interconnected buildings. The player has to drive his car to the different buildings while avoiding the police cars that are chasing him. Upon entering one of the buildings the game switches to a side view perspective of a single screen platform stage. Each stage consists of five levels of platforms and the player uses staircases, lifts and firemen's poles to move between them. In the buildings are various objects that the player has to pick up since they are needed to steal the gemstone. There are nine items in total and it's up to the player to figure out what they do. At the same time the player has to watch out for the guards that try to stop him. </desc>

		<desc>The conception of the Flight Simulator computer game series, still going strong today, began in the late 1970's with "FS1", created by Bruce Artwick of subLOGIC and released in early 1980.  First came the Apple ][, with a very scaled down instrument panel on bottom and outside/radar view on top, then the TRS-80, with mere 128x48 monochrome graphics and thus numbers and bars replacing the panel.  

There was only one aircraft and one region: a 6x6 grid with "mountains".  The user could press "W" and "declare war", entering the WW1 "British Ace" game mode.  The objective was to shoot down enemy planes and bomb their base.

Both the Apple ][ and TRS-80 versions originally came on cassette tape.  The Apple ][ version was updated in 1981 with minor improvements.

Note that the first PC version, Microsoft Flight Simulator (v1.0), was released two years later and is more similar to the 8-bit versions of Flight Simulator II.</desc>

There are an infinite number of stages to progress through.  Every third level is a "challenge stage" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.

Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last "life," you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.

A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final "hit ratio"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.</desc>

		<desc>Genghis Khan is a top-down 2D turn-based grand strategy game, based on the real mongol leader Genghis Khan's life.

The game's main objective is to become the supreme ruler. The player can select from two campaigns: Mongol conquest or World conquest. In the Mongol conquest, players take on the role as Temujin (later known as Genghis Khan), with the goal being to unite all the tribes of Mongolia. In the World conquest, Players can be one of four characters. Similar to the Mongol conquest, players must unite all the countries together. Players can use military force (players must gather an army and lead them into war) or use diplomacy (including things such as strategic marriages). 

The main focus of the game involves management of territory, as the player manages various activities that improve their provinces. Battlefields are hex tiled based, with players giving commands to units groups with the objective of  trying to defeat the forces of the enemy combatants.</desc>

		<name>Ghostbusters</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1984 film of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call to "bust" any ghost hauntings. They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated "proton packs" and "ghost traps", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the "PK level" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for "ghost alarms", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).

As the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

Since the airplane naturally seeks the floor it is necessary to use the wind coming from floor vents to gain height. Obstacles that have to be avoided include tables, candles and electrical outlets. Good items to touch are clocks which give points and sheets of paper which give extra gliders. If touching any obstacles the glider is lost. The number of gliders available is by default four but can be set from one to six. </desc>

Godzilla has four lives, which are depleted by either the enemies touching Godzilla, hitting Godzilla with their attacks, or Godzilla falling into a hole.

Megalon will dig holes in the ground and come up to the surface to get Godzilla. After defeating Megalon, Kumongas will come up from the holes and fire at Godzilla with one of two weapons; a string shot or a color-changing projectile. After defeating several Kumongas, King Ghidorah appears and Godzilla has to defend Minilla. King Ghidorah shoots his gravity beams near himself, and if Minilla touches King Ghidorah, Godzilla loses a life. After defeating Ghidorah, the game restarts.

The 2-Player mode is the same as the one player mode except that two players can alternate between each life, each with their own lives and score meters. (godzilla.wikia.com)</desc>

		<desc>Guardic is a top-down 2d shooter based on the classic premise of pitting a single starfighter against a horde of enemies with the fate of the galaxy at hand. A particularly interesting touch in Guardic is that instead of fighting through a scrolling field filled with enemies, the game places your ship in "rooms" with a fixed amount of opponents that take up the most part of the screen. After defeating every enemy on screen you advance to the next room and so on... Power ups are not activated until you reach the next room (with some exceptions) and even then you have to choose which ones to activate before you enter the fight, which gives the game an additional strategic touch.</desc>

		<desc>Deviating slightly from Compile's usual vertically scrolling fashion, Gulkave is a rather orthodox horizontal shooter. Flying across ? or inside ? a parallax scrolling landscape, your spaceship must singlehandedly take out eight fortresses. In your way stand enemy spaceships that either try to crush you or fire at you, as well as some asteroids thrown in for good measure. For each hit you take, your ship is not destroyed. Instead, you have a power (barrier) bar that decreases gradually until you finally lose a ship. At the end of each level, bonus points are given according to your remaining barrier. Losing a ship means you lose all your weapons upgrades as well. As usual with a shooter from this maker, the powerups come in the shape of numbered pods that are released from Zanac-style blocks. Different upgrades give higher shot counts, more simultaneous bullets or bigger energy waves. At certain score intervals, you're granted bonus ships.

The game was released for both the MSX and Sega's SG-1000 console, the latter version having two levels less.</desc>

In the beginning of the game in a first person view the player has to be quick on the draw to shoot bags of money that fall down the screen, to collect a "bounty" that will be used to buy supplies and cover possible fines during the game.

The main game then takes place in an isometric scrolling play-field that is similar to previous Ultimate Filmation titles. The objective is to collect a bounty by finding and eliminating wanted criminals that are harassing the town. Innocent bystanders will point to the direction of the criminal, shooting them will result in a fine reducing your score. A horse can be obtained to speed up the chase. Once the wanted criminal is encountered, the game again switches to a first person cross hair view, where the first to draw will be the winner. Taking out the criminal will give you a reward that helps you with future expenditures as the cost of ammo and horses changes as the game goes along. Your final tally will become your score at the game's end.</desc>

As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!). If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...</desc>

You start your quest by yourself, but you must find three other companions who will join you to defeat Terarin. You also must venture through five lands. You will find villages, towns and castles in your travels in these lands. In each, you will find or be able to buy weapons and armor (both for you and your companions), medicine and clues. You will also find caves, dungeons, and monuments that are scattered. Some you may enter unhindered. Others will be locked until you find the right person or learn the right spell. 

Also within each land, you will encounter monsters such as evil merchants, Weasly wimps, Unmutaks, Great Lions, Gelfises, Zirods, and many more. Some of these monsters do less damage than others, and  take more damage themselves. You can either attack them yourself using your weapons or spells, or make your companions attack the monsters themselves. When defeated, most monsters will either leave behind some coins, which you can spend to buy stuff at the towns, or some items, which you can also use to defeat monsters.

However, not all inhabitants are monsters. You will also meet merchants and travelers who might tell you where to go and what to do.</desc>

In a corner of a universe, a concentration of anti-matter led to the creation of an entire star, breeding forms of life threatening to destroy the world. Human beings, in an effort to save the universe, created the powerful Andorogynus - a life form capable of being male and female at once - and sent it on a mission to destroy the creation of anti-matter.

Andorogynus (sic) is a top-down shoot-em-up. The player controls the titular hero(ine), shooting at constantly attacking enemies. Unlike in most games of the type, the screen scrolls down rather than up. The protagonist is equipped with a default single shot and has protective orbs revolving around that damage nearby enemies. The weapon can be enhanced (rapid fire, three-way fire, etc.) by collecting randomly descending power-ups. The player controls the male incarnation of the protagonist initially, but later switches to the female one.</desc>

While the clock ticks down, he should try to maneuver past his opponents and to steer clear of obstacles on the side of the road. Beating the clock extends the time and draws a new backdrop to race in.</desc>

The goal is to sail around until the player finds a pirate ship (the friendly green merchant ships will simply provide hints) and clear the boss. Doing so will allow the player to collect a port key which allows them to set anchor on one of the titular seven islands. The player must then remove the boss of that island and recover the treasure. At which point, the process must be repeated.</desc>

As the game progresses, Gaou can power up by obtaining phoenix plumes to activate special weapons and other items to help him gain abilities such as invulnerability and special shots. In order to reach the final boss and pay a visit to the phoenix, Gaou must obtain a series of keys scattered across the stages - and must even backtrack to find others. The game is over when all three lives are gone - or when Gaou has reached the phoenix's lair.</desc>

When playing against the computer, the player will play against an opponent that uses metal clubs, which hit farther than the standard wooden clubs.

In addition to stroke and match play, players can obtain passwords that allow a replay of any spectacular shots that are made (eagles, holes-in-one, and double-eagles).</desc>

Hole In One Special can be played  up to two players at three difficulty levels: average, expert and pro.
You can compete in stroke play, match play and tournament play. The tournament play can be set at one to four days.

The main difference with the other two releases in the Hole In One series for MSX is that Hole In One Special makes full use of the MSX2 graphical capabilities and can only be played on MSX2 computers.</desc>

In order to get his cheese, Chumy must go between platforms connected by ladders, all the time avoiding the other creatures. Luckily, Chumy can jump very far, across and above the nasties. Chumy also has an arsenal of cans to throw at the enemies. Most die after just one hit, whereas others are more impervious to attacks. The rabbits are particularly dangerous, since they may pounce at you unexpectedly, they being able to jump just as far as Chumy. When Chumy eats cheese (or bombs or biscuits), he moves slower due to the extra weight. When the mouse has fed on all the cheese, it can take the dust chute down from the top level to the bottom, and make its way to the exit and on to the next level. Control Chumy with the cursor keys and X for jumping, C for throwing.

This game has also been included, in a slightly revised form, on Compile's Disk Station #0.</desc>

Hydlide is an action game with strong role-playing elements. The player has to explore vast wilderness areas, descending into dungeons and eliminating enemies on the way. Combat system is similar to the one implemented in Ys series: attacking enemies requires the player to "bump" into them, at the same time preventing them from attacking the playable character from the sides and the back. The player can change between defensive and offensive stances by pressing a single button. Magic spells can also be used to dispose of the enemies. The player character grows stronger and gains better parameters as he advances in the game.</desc>

		<desc>The third entry in the Hydlide series, continuing its action RPG legacy. Character creation allows the player to choose one of the four character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, the protagonist uses melee or long-ranged weapons or casts magic spells. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player is required to press the attack button during melee combat, instead of simply "bumping" into the enemies. There is an internal clock in the game, which makes it necessary for the protagonist to sleep periodically and regain his strength. The main character also has to eat from time to time, otherwise his hit points will gradually decrease. The morality system from the previous game returns: killing friendly creatures will reduce the player's morality level, which will eventually have an effect on one of the game's most decisive battles.</desc>

The people of Fairy Land were intoxicated with peace. At that time an incident occurred. A Consciousness filled with evil awoke and it created new monsters, brought the dead back to life, and wanted to dominate Fairy Land again. The monks were one of the first who noticed this and warned the people about it but they didn't listen and left the monks disappointed. The monks prayed to God and asked Him if there was a Savior.</desc>

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The Famicom version loses the hammer throw and the high jump, but the NES version restores the high jump while adding skeet shooting, the triple jump and archery as events. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If the player wants to go to the next event or round then they will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

The full sequence of events is - swimming, skeet shooting, gymnastics, archery, triple jumping and weightlifting. You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one.

Swimming involves moving left and right as fast as possible, while pressing fire when a breath is required. Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing - though elevation and wind factors affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.

If the player wants to go to the next event or round, they will have to qualify by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum targets.</desc>

The grids can be occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their outcome depends on the characters' statistics.</desc>

		<desc>Cult hero Matthew Smith followed up Manic Miner with a seminal platform game. Having struck it lucky in the first game, Willy now owns a lavish mansion with over 60 rooms linked in a 3D plane, and must tidy it all before his housekeeper will let him sleep.

Each room has its own hazards, such as spikes, revolving razors and ropes. The route through the house must be navigated carefully, due to the multiple entrances to some rooms - this is perhaps the first action game where mapping is an advantage. Another innovation, to the chagrin of players everywhere, is manual protection - a sheet of colour-coded numbers.</desc>

		<desc>This arcade game is a cross between Breakout and Space Invaders. Player controls an electromechanical robot, who walks along the top of a wall consisting of bricks and jumps on it. A line of bugs is coming to him from the bottom of the screen in vertical direction, while the bomb is flying in horizontal direction in the center. Bugs may be killed by jumping on the wall, which results in a brick falling from its bottom. The number of jumps is equal to the bottom brick's distance from the robot. Flying bomb may eliminate the brick until it reaches the bug, but if the bug is killed, its bad or good soul will fly to the top, where robot may collect it and make influence on his mood. After the bug is eliminated, another one will start to crawl from the bottom. There is a snail moving in horizontal direction at the very bottom of the screen, which is mostly covered by the bugs crawling to the top, and it may be hit by brick in case of success also. 

The player is transferred to another level after necessary quantity of the bugs is killed. But beware! Robot's energy is exhausted, when bug is crawling upon him, and the robot becomes non-functional if the bugs reached the very top of the screen or if the robot falls off the wall.</desc>

Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</desc>

You can defend yourself by means of scrolls with obscure magician runes, throwing cards and other weapons to be picked up en route.

The magic cards and magic spells have a limited range or last only for a short period of time but can be powered up by collecting the runes found after destroying a formation of red flames-shaped enemies or waving an black and white flag.
Several items (mostly pearls) will be found along the way and can be picked up and used to defeat the enemy creatures.

		<desc>King's Knight is a fantasy-themed top-down shooter where four heroes have to unite to defeat a dragon and rescue a princess in despair. It was one of the first games published by Square Soft (now one-half of Square Enix). King's Knight is a variation on Konami's Knightmare which sold extremely well.

The first four stages involve you powering up your characters as far as they can go, picking up shields (to increase defense), boots (to increase speed), swords (to increase attack power), and spell icons (which will be required to be held by everyone for the final storm on the castle), defeating monsters along the way. The power-ups are hidden underneath mountains, rocks, and houses. Nearly everything can be shot at and destroyed. The heroes are, in order:

Ray Jack, the Knight, who possesses strong attacking power; Kaliva, the Wizard, who is good with magic and jumping; Barusa, the Monster, who has a strong defense; and Toby, the Thief, who can move swiftly.

It is necessary to keep all four heroes alive for the fifth and final stage, because there are certain points that the group cannot get past if one of the party members has died.</desc>

The game uses the isometric viewpoint in a manner similar to the later Head Over Heels, using monochrome but detailed graphics and techniques to avoid flickering sprites. The game lasts for 40 days and nights - at night your character turns into a werewolf. Ultimate's individual style of eschewing straightforward instructions in favor of feature lists and riddles is put to good use here, with the story detailed in a rhyming poem of sorts.</desc>

Popolon who tried to rescue his wife Aphrodite from a villain named Hudnos. The
sequel takes place right after you rescued Aphrodite.  Now you play as both 
Popolon and Aphrodite, who will try to to rescue their future baby kidnapped 
by a dark priest named Galious. The gameplay is a mix between action and RPG.
You have the side-scrolling actions throughout six worlds and yet at the same
time there are some RPG elements included such as having to find certain items
to complete certain tasks. Maze of Galious stays true to its name with its huge
and sometimes confusing maze-like worlds to be explored.Majou Densetsu II: Daimashikyou Galious is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1987.</desc>

Before long you realize that you are in fact a hero who must save this world from the evil Gog, an ancient demon awaiting resurrection, otherwise you won't ever be able to return home.

Shalom is the third entry in Konami's Knightmare series. Unlike the previous games, it is much less heavy on action and is structured primarily like an adventure game with emphasis on interaction with characters and exploration. You navigate your hero through a large top-down world, interacting with characters along the way. The interaction is done via a command menu with verbs such as "Look", "Talk", "Take", etc. From time to time you'll have to fight enemies. The battles take place on a separate screen, and you attack the enemy with your weapons in real time.</desc>

		<desc>Ping Pong recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis. To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.</desc>

		<desc>The aim of the game is to guide a ball through 50 levels of walls, barriers and general obstacles. You control a bat, which must 'serve' the ball into play, and then follow it through the level, deflecting it before it falls behind you, as this costs you one of your 4 lives. Initially the obstacles are all static, but moving barriers add timing, reactions and luck to proceedings.

There are also several bonus objects, which are collected by passing through them. These include an L for an extra ball and dual rectangles to give you a second bat which moves around at random.

The game also comes with a full level editor, allowing you to design new levels and save them to tape or disk.(Moby Ganes)</desc>

		<desc>The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</desc>

Players control a Valkyrie fighter that launches from the Macross to rescue Lynn Minmay from the Zentradi. Many waves of enemies must be overcome by evading or shooting at them. A radar at the bottom of the screen displays incoming enemies and obstacles. As in the series, the Valkyrie can transform into one of three different modes, but cannot fire any weapons while transforming: in Fighter mode, it is fast and maneuverable. Speed and maneuverability are lower in Gerwalk mode, which can be useful for getting through tight spots. In Battroid mode, the Valkyrie's projectiles are self-seeking. Only in Fighter and Gerwalk modes, the Valkyrie can launch a powerful missile spread that can take out a lot of enemies at once. The spread is limited to three firings per wave, though. </desc>

		<name>Maison Ikkoku Final</name>
		<desc>The game is based on the manga Maison Ikkoku by Rumiko Takahashi.

Set in Tokyo of the 80's, the story can be described as a romantic tale with a touch of comedy. It centers on a boarding house which is managed by the young and lovely widow Kyoko Otonashi. The protagonist is a college student named Yusaki Godai, and his relationship with Kyoko is the main plot line. The game's story approximately corresponds to the middle volumes of the manga until the conclusion.

The game is a "puzzle-less" adventure, the gameplay mostly focusing on simply depleting all the verb commands at every given screen and moving between locations. The commands include the usual "Look", "Talk", and Move" typical for Japanese adventures (no "Think" command), but also context-sensitive commands "Eat", "Drink", etc., as well as the possibility to use certain inventory items.</desc>

Players control Yusaku Godai and will need to help him find a secret photograph that's been hidden away by the manager. Godai will need to bribe the inhabitants, which constantly move around the house in order to get access to Kyoko's room. But even if Godai makes it into the manager's room and tries to look at the framed photo, something will always happen which will force Godai to leave the room. Thus, after multiple attempts, Godai makes the (il)logical decision to gather photos of all the inhabitants of the boarding house to make Kyoko show him the photo. The game has the player move between locations in the boarding house and the town, constantly running out of money, and meeting all the cast from the original comic book, including Nikaido who did not appear in the anime.</desc>

The story mainly deals with King Egger, the villain, who has captured princess Lala, who is similar to Lolo, only she is red. Again it's up to Lolo to rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and solving the puzzle rooms laid out before him. You must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next room(s). All the rooms are connected but not all the room entrances or exits are closed.
To fight the monsters Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers. There are numerous types of obstacles in the rooms. Emerald Framers are green blocks that Lolo may push around freely. To make it all more challenging there are also numerous terrain obstacles, like water, sand and grass which have all different drawbacks for Lolo.</desc>

		<desc>Near the end of the 20th century, a small fortified nation named Outer Heaven (founded by a mysterious war hero whose name and identity are shrouded in secrecy) is threatening the nations of the "West" with the development of a new prototype weapon named Metal Gear, a walking tank which is capable of launching nuclear warheads from anywhere on the globe. As FOX-HOUND's (an elite black ops unit) newest recruit, going by the codename of Solid Snake, your mission is to infiltrate Outer Heaven and rescue your missing comrade, Grey Fox (who was captured after a failed infiltration), while gathering intelligence on Metal Gear. 

In order to fulfill this objective, the player must collect various weapons and equipments (including keycards for further access into the fortress), while avoiding visual contact with the enemy. The player must also confront bosses in the form of Outer Heaven's elite mercenary force and rescue hostages hidden within the fortress in order to increase player rank, which gives Snake an extended life bar and increased storage capacity for replenishable items and ammo. The player can use a wireless transceiver to come in touch with their commanding officer, Big Boss, to learn more about their current mission objectives or contact one of the local resistance members operating covertly within the fortress to gain useful tips and insights.</desc>

		<name>Metal Gear 2 - Solid Snake</name>
		<desc>In 1999, a great scientist named Kio Marv invented "oilix", a special petroleum-purifying substance that was supposed to help in the upcoming oil crisis. Shortly after the invention became known in the world, Dr. Marv was abducted. An investigation showed that he was held captive in Zanzibar Land, an isolated state in Central Asia which was ruled by a group of mercenaries from all around the world. Having oilix in addition to nuclear weapons are bound to Zanzibar an invincible state that would sooner or later attempt to conquer the entire world. Roy Campbell, ex-commander of special unit FOXHOUND, sends Solid Snake, the man who has single-handedly brought down the military nation of Outer Heaven four years ago, on a mission to infiltrate Zanzibar and to bring back the scientist and his invention.

Like its predecessor, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake is a stealth game. The driving element of the gameplay is to stay unnoticed. If guards spot you, you don't have much chance in combat, unless you are armed with appropriate weapons, which aren't easily acquired. Snake can use a variety of weapons and gadgets to help him survive during his mission. He can also hide behind objects, punch guards, and crawl. From time to time he'll have to participate in boss battles, where stealth won't help any more.</desc>

Now it becomes your goal to collect all the keys, open the vault with the collected keys and then return to the middle of the labyrinth to enter the door and go to the next floor.

There are at least three hostile green men running around in the labyrinth who are trying to catch you. You'll loose a life when they catch you.</desc>

Using joystick or cursor keys, a white dot representing the club is moved around a black dot representing the ball. This indicates angle, and the distance from the ball sets the putting force. Putting the ball in the hole in as few strokes as possible is your objective: less than 8 strokes gives higher scores and more than 12 strokes yields no points at all.</desc>

		<desc>The famous detective Sir Charles Foxworth is taking a holiday on the Mississippi with his servant Regis on the Delta Princess. He's just taking a stroll around the upper deck of the ship when he discovers an open cabin door. Behind it: a dead man. As it turns out, the body of Raleigh Cartwright III. Sir Charles has three days to find the murderer, because then, the ship will reach New Orleans, giving the culprit a safe chance to escape. The joystick controls the player's sprite to move into the respective direction, and pressing the button opens a menu with appropriate commands for the current situation. Walk around, Inspect an item, or examine evidence. You will meet some characters who also happen to be suspects. Use these encounters as a fact-finding session. Take notes on what he or she has said. Share these notes with other passengers and crew members. But your first job is to find the body. Until you do, any information you gather will be of little value. Once you find the body, the other passengers will prove to be much more talkative. Collect as many notes and evidence as you can to solve the mystery. Once you think that you have it solved, make an accusation by going to the character that you want to accuse and by using the joystick, point to Talk to [character's name], and press the joystick button. Then point to Accuse [character's name] and press the joystick button. Depending on the amount of evidence collected, you will know if your hunch was right or wrong. Murder on the Mississippi has four possible endings with many variations on each one. Don't let the Delta Princess arrive to New Orleans before you solve the mystery, or the murderer will get away.</desc>

AKA: Secret Treasure of Moai

In The Secret Treasure Of Moai your goal is to reach the level exit at the top by climbing and destroying the rock structures before you run out of time or got caught by enemies.

The rocks can be destroyed with the hammer that you carry. When destroying rock formations you might find special items and you should collect these or otherwise you might end up being unable to reach the level exit. You also won't reach the end of the level if you destroy the wrong rock structures or destroy them in the wrong order. As you progress in the game the puzzles to reach the exit become more challenging.

The game contains bonus stages in which you have to collect as much diamonds as you can within the time limit. (Moby Games)</desc>

However, the color of the mallet changes frequently and the player has to respond to it because hitting a mole of the same color as the mallet will result in decrease of the score bar. If the player is unable to fill the score in time (indicated by a timer bar), the game is lost. There are 9 difficulty levels, with higher difficulty featuring more frequent appearance of moles of the same color as the mallet, thus requiring more attention of the player.</desc>

Mon Mon Monster is an arcade platform game with some touches of adventure. With your monster, you have to make your way through a maze of screens. Your path is blocked at all times by boulders and annoying creatures. The action takes place over the entire screen with the exception of some information at the bottom. In the fields you can find lots of useful objects such as "rocks", the normal method of defeating an opponent is simply done with the fire button. With this you reach the effect of a punch stroke or when you are standing at a distance, you shoot a projectile. You throw the boulders using a combination of the stick and 2nd fire button. Not really easy but practice makes perfect. You can also find extra life or supplement the remaining energy. Even secret passages are not lacking in this game nor are difficult passages such as water fountains. With a press of the STOP key you pause the game and a card is also placed on the screen. On that card you can read your current posfty as well as the screens you have already viewed and also the position of the Boss is indicated. However, this card does not help you much, since you still have to reach your goal through secret passages. I have not yet finished the first internship. Have you lost all your lives you can continue to play through a continuous option. However, you will still start at the beginning of the internship, but items that have been retained will be retained. Mon Mon Monster looks graphically well-cared for The music is welcome, thanks to the fact that the musical possibilities of the FM-Pac are used. The movements are smooth and "Frankie1" lets you steer well The idea is not very interesting, but still fascinating.</desc>

The vehicle is constantly moving right and the player can speed up or slow down, jump, and shoot (simultaneously firing upwards and forwards.) There are 25 checkpoints along the way, each symbolized with a letter from A to Z, and serving as a respawn point. Every five checkpoints mark a separate "stage" within the entire course; reaching the end of a stage under the par time grants a large score bonus. 

Dangers on the Moon include rocks (small and big ones) which can be shot to pieces or jumped over, pits which must be jumped, and UFO's which fire at the player or bombard the ground (creating pits). Later the player also comes upon stationary tanks which fire missiles (that can be destroyed with the player's own shots), landmines, carnivorous plants that pop up out of pits, and rocket cars which stalk the buggy from behind before rushing forward in an attempt to ram it down. 

After completing the first course (the "Beginner Course") the player can try his skill on the harder Champion Course. </desc>

You control Mr. Do! the clown who has a hammer which can be used to knock out the blocks in the floor. Wandering throughout the castle are deadly unicorns which are constantly trying to catch you. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible and to progress through the increasingly difficult castles.

There are two ways to complete a castle; you can either destroy all of the deadly unicorns by crushing them with blocks, or you can knock out all of the blocks which have a cherry symbol on them. In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life.

The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous. (Moby Games)</desc>

		<name>Nemesis</name>
		<desc>Nemesis is the first entry in the long-running Gradius series on the Game Boy. Its side-scrolling shoot'em up gameplay follows the series template closely. Players control the Vic Viper through five levels, most based on levels in earlier entries, for a kind of 'greatest hits' of the series. There is a cave level (as in level 1 of the original Gradius), the mandatory Moai stage, a Gigeresque organic level, a graveyard (similar to bonus stages in the MSX and PC Engine version of the original Gradius) and a high-tech base. Besides the classic core ship in the first level, all boss enemies are entirely new.

The cycling Gradius power-up system is reused here: collected power ups advance the power meter which can be activated at any time to gain the highlighted item. The line-up includes the classic selection of speedups, missiles, dual shots, lasers, option satellites and forcefields.

The game allows players to start in any of the five levels and even to set the number of lives to a maximum of 99.</desc>

		<desc>Between the Seas of the Seven Islands and the purple Mountains lies a valley. Time was that this area was safe and hospitable, however darkness then came - killing many of the inhabitants and warping the minds of the others. Many have gone there, none have returned - can you be the first?

Nightshade is an arcade adventure in scrolling isometric 3D (an advance on earlier Ultimate titles such as Knight Lore, which were flick-screen), with directional or rotational controls. You can take 3 hits from the various roaming monsters - turning from white to yellow to green as you take them - but a 4th costs you one of your five lives. Objects can be thrown at these foes, but only if you have any.

The map is made up of medieval-style buildings, which are visible while you are on the outside but whose roofs lift when you enter them, to ensure full visibility. There are four super-villains to destroy (a mad monk, a skeleton, a ghost, and Mr Grimreaper), and you must find the right objects to do this.(Moby Games)</desc>

		<name>Ninja Jajamaru-kun</name>
		<desc>In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate. 

Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.

In each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.

As the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a "boss". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.

Items can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.

The items in this game are:Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.

Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!

Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.

Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.

Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.
Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!

Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.

Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.</desc>

		<desc>The game tells another story in Ninja-kun series. This time itâ€™s a platform game with some twists. There are two tasks alternating through levels: you are required either to kill every enemy in the level (as in the previous games) or simply to reach the exit. Running into enemies usually wonâ€™t kill you, however if you are hit by a single projectile, youâ€™ll have to start from a checkpoint. Enemies vary from plain ninjas to giant skeletons or killer fish. Each level has a time limit, and when this limit is close to an end a fire wheel of death will appear on the screen, chasing Ninja-kun.

Ninja-kun has some techniques for successful progression though the levels: many enemies can be temporarily stunned by jumping on them or hitting them from below; and ninja can obtain some power-ups including boomerang, bombs, a devastating fire attack or invincibility. Ninja-kun is capable of wall climbing and wall jumping, the latter requiring some practice from the player.

The levels (called â€œscenesâ€ in-game) are scattered through mountains, caves, beaches and underwater locations. You can choose which set of levels youâ€™ll start in by playing a mini-game at the beginning.</desc>

The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.

The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on.</desc>

In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.

Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</desc>

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

Game A lets the player play until they attain a score of at least 3000. The goal is to achieve this score as fast they possibly can. Though, the game can still end prematurely by running out of balls to shoot. Game B lets the player try to get as high of a score as possible, but with an added time limit.

The game contains over 200 different board layouts to choose from. At the main menu, just choosing Game A or B will randomly assign a board for the player to play on, while choosing Select A or B will let the player select their own board of choice to play on.

The gameplay is mainly passive. Players can only adjust the shooting pressure knob which effects the speed and location of where the balls will land.(Moby Games)</desc>

		<name>Pastfinder</name>
		<desc>Pastfinder is a vertically scrolling action game which takes place in the year 8878. You are a member of an elite team of explorers known as the Pastfinders. Your goal is to search deadly, radiated planets for various artifacts and time capsules and to deliver them safely to a base. 

At the beginning of each level, you will be presented with the map screen and can select which sector you would like to explore next. At first, only a small portion of the map will be visible but as you make your way through the game additional portions become visible. The amount of radiation in each sector may vary, and the map is color coded to indicate just how deadly a particular sector may be. Next you will have an opportunity to equip your ship with supplies; these include heavy metal (slows the rate at which your ship absorbs radiation), beam shields (protects from enemy fire), scramblers (prevent enemies from tracking you), and a deradiator (decreases accumulated radiation). Equipped items will last until your ship crashes or is destroyed, and additional items can be found on the planet surfaces.

Finally you will be able to explore the planets surface in the sector you have selected! Controlling your ship, you need to avoid walls, enemy craft and other obstacles on the surface while searching for artifacts. Your ship has the ability to jump over obstacles as well as fire lasers to destroy enemies. Each section of the planet is fill with deadly radiation; the longer you're there, the more radiation your ship absorbs. A gauge at the bottom of the screen indicates your ships radiation level, and if it gets too high the ship is destroyed. From time to time floating crystals will appear; shooting these will reduce your ships radiation level a bit. When you finally reach the end of the sector, you will be returned to the map screen where you can choose another sector and begin exploring again.

The game ends when you have lost all of your ships; additional ships can occasionally be found on the planet's surface and are also earned every 5000 points. </desc>

Playing as the hero Perseus, you have to go to 5 different worlds, each with its own theme, and kill Satan's guardians (end of level bosses). 
A friendly wizard has also given you a magical flying horse called Pegasus, to help you in your quest.

Each world has 10 levels, and half of them are played flying on Pegasus back, and the other half walking, without your magical horse. When flying, the game plays like a Shoot'em up, but when walking, it's a platform game, and you have to rely on your sword.

You can buy weapon upgrades and other bonuses, if you collect enough diamonds. They can be found spread out all over the levels, and fallen enemies drop them sometimes as well. If your health drops too low, you can also heal yourself by spending some diamonds.

After every world, you get a password, letting you continue from the same place the next time you play. That's fortunate, because this game takes a long time to complete.

This is a loose collection of bricks that can be shifted by pushing them or firing into them. Suck spiders start invading from the edge of your property, and you must shoot them before they shoot you. The spider's dead bodies can provide extra material for your house. After the first wave of 30 spiders has been killed, your bride arrives, and you receive bonus points for the size of your house. The next wave of spiders then arrives, but now you must also protect your wife. This can be done by surrounding her with bricks, dead spiders, and "stoppers" which you can drop in an empty space in front of you. If you or your wife get shot, you lose a life. After every 30 spiders killed, you receive a bonus, as well as a small amount of time to prepare for the next wave.</desc>

The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.

The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)

The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</desc>

		<path>./Puzzle Panic (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Puzzle Panic</name>
		<desc>Puzzle Panic is a 1984 puzzle game created by Ken Uston in collaboration with designers Ron Karr, Bob Polin, and Paul Wernick. Ken Uston was better known as a blackjack player and strategist, but he was also a video game author and the creator of Puzzle Panic. The game was originally released on the Commodore 64 and Atari 400/800 in 1984, but later received an MSX port in 1986 by SystemSoft.

Puzzle Panic is more of a minigame compilation than a defined puzzle game. There are eleven different "levels" that can be played, each of which is somehow a pattern based short puzzle game. These range from collecting certain items in a specific order, to reaching a set point under certain conditions.

The player begins the game in a room filled with question marks. There are two doors available, and walking into each one teleports the player to a new game (while the other brings the player to a new room, with two different doors; essentially a hub world). Within these games, there are several modes of difficulty to play through (accessed through three different doors within each game) before moving onto a different screen. All of the games can be accessed at anytime by bringing up the menu (by pressing F2).

When the games are played in order rather than by the menu selection, they are (in reality) part of a larger puzzle, where each puzzle is actually represented by its own symbol, and interaction with the gates at the end of each is integral. In fact, the final puzzle requires the player to select the symbol that represents each level, as well as the order they were played in sequence. The final puzzle was known as "Metasequence," Ken Uston's "ultimate challenge." This larger puzzle was originally intended to be part of a real life contest, where players who managed to complete the puzzle in time (by August 31, 1984) won a trip to Atlantic City with Ken Uston.(Giant Bomb)</desc>

The player's character can shoot stakes that kill the monsters and stick to the blocks (he can jump on these stakes and eventually break those blocks, clearing the path to the exit door). If he touches any of the monsters or dangerous environments, he transforms into a blue frog and the player loses one life. There are several items that can be collected: some of them are immobile, some randomly float around the screen.

On the top of the screen there are a inventory of collected items, a timer and the number of lives. Both the cartridge and disk versions allow saving the game between levels.</desc>

		<name>R-type</name>
		<desc>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</desc>

Once you fulfill your quota you can enter the next stage through an exit that opens on the left side of the screen. Collecting biteslime increases the length of your snake. If the head of your snake hits a wall, an enemy or part of its body you lose a life. Replicart enhances the basic Snake game formula by adding power ups like a Time Stop, which freezes enemies, speed increase/decrease or level warps.</desc>

		<name>Rise Out From Dungeons</name>
		<desc>Rise Out From Dungeons is a platform game where you must guide an unnamed character through 20 dungeons avoiding traps and red-colored men. The graphics and game mechanics are strikingly similar to Lode Runner, but with a twist.

As in Lode Runner, you must collect several objects all over the level while avoiding red-colored men, there are many stairs and gaps where you fall down if you are not careful. If you fall in the water, you die. You can also destroy blocks by shooting them with your gun. Curiously enough, the "red men" can't be defeated by your gun, and they will follow you everywhere you go, only to respawn if they reach a point where there's no way out. There are some elements which look like ropes but they are in fact just a special kind of platform: you can always walk across them safely, but if you land on them after falling down, you will just fall through them, so they actually work as traps. Other game elements include a hidden key used to open a door which leads to the stair leading out from the dungeon.

The objective in each dungeon is simply to "rise out" from them, and that can be done by climbing a stair which passes through the dungeon ceiling.

Six robots from six countries fight in a tournament that, apart from the robot element, is closer to American, Mexican or Japanese wrestling than the classic kind of wrestling. Each player uses three keys or buttons to execute various attacks in the classic "button masher" beat'em'up manner, with different button combinations triggering different techniques according to the proximity between the combatants. Each robot has its own arsenal of special moves. The ring is viewed from an elevated position and allows movement in two dimensions. The losing robot is turned into scrap ready for recycling, with the winner going on the next round.</desc>

		<name>Sasa</name>
		<desc>This is a shooting game with a twist. You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. 

The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.</desc>

The game is broken up into four zones that are composed of eight areas each. In each area players have to collect all the visible items laying around to complete that area. Once all the items are collected in the seven areas of a zone, players can then enter the eighth area where they will find one of their bandmates locked inside a cage. While collecting all the visible items, players will be continuously attacked by enemies that they can either try to jump and dodge or shoot their projectile weapon at them. Getting hit by an enemy will decrease the players life, which is already constantly draining.

One of the items the player collects are moneybags. Collected moneybags earn the player money which can in turn be spent at the various shops found throughout the game. Shops sell life potions, stronger weapons, and also musical instruments for each band member.</desc>

Three Russian submarines have been located in the New York sewer system and they have blocked off the system.
Sam's only way out of the sewer system is to destroy the Russian submarines. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.
Sam can't go back... once he's gone through the City Sewer Department seals the tunnel. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.

The sewer system has three types of sewer tunnels. Tunnels with solid dry floors, tunnels with a water passage in the middle and tunnels with pits. 
Sam can walk, run and creep through the tunnels but Sam can't move as quickly in water.
Sam can move from tunnel to tunnel by entering one of the passages that appear occasionally on his way.
Each time he enters a new sewer, Sam receives a fresh supply of oxygen.

On it's way through the sewer system Sam is under attack by nasties like rats, bats, spiders and more.
The ultimate nasties are the Russian submarines. They are located only in water canals. The status bar at the top of the screen contains a distance indicator. It tells you how far Sam has traveled into the sewer. If it's red, it means there's a dreaded submarine at the end of the sewer.
The more nasty elements you shoot, the higher you'll score.</desc>

		<desc>Shanghai is one of the first video game adaptations of the tile-based game played with the Chinese mahjong stones - essentially a puzzle game that has little to do with real mahjong rules.

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</desc>

		<name>Shiryou Sensen. War Of The Dead</name>
		<desc>Due to mysterious circumstances, a flourishing city called Chinese Hill was cut off the rest of the world. Investigators found out that most of the buildings were destroyed, horrifying creatures are roaming the wilderness, and the few survivors have no means of escaping. The SSWAT (Supernatural Special Weapon Attack Team) sends an agent named Laila to the city. The young woman has powerful psychic abilities, which can enhance her firearms, helping her deal with the monsters. She must rescue the survivors and escort them to safety, at any cost...

Shiryo Sensen - War of the Dead is an action game with slight RPG elements. The player navigates Laila over the top-down "world map": the ruined city has basically turned into large wilderness areas with a few buildings that are represented by icons on the map and can be explored. Enemies attack randomly. The battles take place on separate side-scrolling screens, and are fully action-based. Laila can jump, duck, and attack with melee or weapons or firearms (which require ammunition). Typically there are several enemies on the screen; Laila escapes the battle if she reaches the end of the short side-scrolling area. 

The goal of the game is to find and rescue the few survivors trapped in the buildings infested by enemies. Laila has to bring these survivors back to the church. Even though the map is almost completely open to the player (especially after Laila acquires a boat, which makes the world fully explorable), the rescuing must be completed in a linear fashion, by talking to characters in different buildings and receiving clues. The game has a day/night cycle; Laila can sleep at any time, which will restore a portion of her health.</desc>

		<name>Shindobaddo Nanatsu no Bouken</name>
		<desc>As Sinbad the pirate, you have not been successful recently, and there is mutiny brewing among your crew. The only way to appease them is to find your father?s buried treasure, hidden underground on Corinthia. Trogs and Soldier Ants heavily guard the island, but you have your trusty sword to help. Make sure your food and water levels stay high enough by regularly checking your status.

Viewed from a first-person view, Sinbad must navigate the building in single steps, moving in the current direction or rotating each time. Each of the 54 rooms has a pattern on its door giving some idea of its function. Some are empty, but many contain either objects or hazards (though there is no clue as to whether it is an object or a hazard). Objects include a Compass, a Bag of Gold Coins, a Treasure Chest, and the Magic Lamp, and are automatically collected. The hazards are either a magnet (damaging your compass), Trogs (who are defeated by checking the letter on its shield and pressing the appropriate letter key to jab him with the sword). Soldier Ants are scared into submission (using your torch) in the same way, but they will still lurk menacingly. The third type of room is a Clue Room, which requires the Magic Lamp, and sees you gain a hint from the Wizard.

There are six skill levels ? not only do they increase the number of Trogs and Ants, they also change the letter you must press to defeat them. The position in the alphabet of the killing key is the value of the letter displayed, plus the skill level (so if you see H on level 3, press K, for example.

Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved! By the last levels, you must plan 40 steps in advance.</desc>

		<desc>Based on a special effects movie, Space Camp takes place in space (it says so in big letters on the cover). You guide your spaceship through orbit, avoiding meteor showers, military satellites and other obstacles. The control method is much like "lunar lander" type games, but in zero gravity, so a quick thrust with the engines will move the ship indefinitely. Since you have limited oxygen and energy reserves, you must pick up oxygen bottles and energy canisters from the space stations you fly past.

After the vertically scrolling space sequence, you jump out the ship and explore a space station. The control method is the same, and like before, you must keep an eye on oxygen and energy. Apart from said resources, the space stations have hidden treasures hidden below certain panels. Find treasure by gliding across the panels and pushing the joystick button. Certain panels will lead you to hidden treasure chambers. All the while, you must watch out for the space station's guardian, which moves in your direction when you activate your thrusters or press the button. As long as you just glide, the guardian stays put.</desc>

		<name>Space Invaders</name>
		<desc>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank."  The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!

Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision (see Battlezone  and Asteroids).  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.

You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</desc>

		<desc>On the surface, Space Trouble looks like an orthodox shooter, but it has an unorthodox twist: Don't shoot! You navigate your ship through an asteroid field, with a finite fuel supply. From time to time, enemy ships come into view and try to hunt you down. Shoot them down, but bear in mind that each shot costs a little bit of fuel. Sometimes, you will encounter a fuel supply, and strewn throughout the game are powerups which boost your "flight record", which is turned to score as you complete a level. As the game progresses, the asteroids change into other obstacles, such as flying saucers, mines and organic blobs which take several shots to kill. Each enemy ship also has its own movement patterns, some hunting you down, some avoiding your shots, and some just bumbling straight forward. 

When you've passed four different fields, you encounter a mother ship. Docking with the ship requires minute precision, or you will crash and die. The ship teleports you to the next level, which is much like the first.</desc>

		<name>Star Command</name>
		<desc>Star Command is a sci-fi role-playing game set in a vast fictional universe and featuring tactical space and squad-level combat, similar to SSI's Pool of Radiance released the same year and other games of the Gold Box series. The game has nothing to do with Star Command Deluxe or Star Command: Revolution.

The game plays in a distant future. Earth is a distant memory, having been destroyed long ago. The small human population is concentrated in a small portion of the galaxy, called "The Triangle" due to its form, and threatened from its neighbors: The Alpha border is plagued by pirates, recently united under a certain "Blackbeard", the Beta border is frequently ambushed by an intelligent insect-like alien race who is thought to plan an all-out war. The third border leads to largely unknown territory with space-faring robots of unclear origin. The only hope for mankind is the Star Command, the headquarter of military forces. You control a spaceship crew, trying to secure peace by completing missions issued by Star Command.

The game starts at Startport Luna, where you first will have to assemble and equip your crew and buy a starship before rushing out saving humanity. Assembling the crew, i.e. character generation, is quite detailed and done by first recruiting and then training characters. Each character has seven basic stats like Strength and Intelligence. If the stats look okay, you select one of four classes (Pilots for flying ships and communicating with aliens, Marines for espionage, Soldiers for fighting, and finally Espers with strange psi powers). The character now has to be trained for eight years; each year, you select a skill to be trained, and, if you're lucky, the character increases his skill -- he may also learn nothing. Skills can be trained more than once, increasing the effective skill level. All in all, there are 18 skills, with a different set available for each class. Some trainings does not improve skills, but basic stats -- Special Forces, for example, increases speed and accuracy.

Character usually start out as Privates, but they the rank can be increased by going to Officer's school. There are 13 ranks up to Grand Admiral, with increasing pay -- money is sparse, so this may be a good choice. Then again, it may be not. Later in the game, with enough funds, you can create clones of your character to replace him when he dies. Character also age during play.

After you have created your crew, it's time to spend your money. First of all, you need a spaceship -- there are nine different ships, with different attributes like armor or fuel capacity. The ship may be upgraded by several systems, including from engines, guns, shields, drop ships, computers, etc. Finally, you have to equip your crew, again choosing among a vast selection of armor, weapons and miscellaneous items. Having a fully equipped crew at your disposal, you're now ready to get some mission from the Space Command and launch your ship.

While in space, you are shown a view of the environment, with commands at the bottom and the crew or ship status on the right. The galaxy is quite big, consisting of 32x32 sectors, each containing several systems, with each one having up to 10 planets. You can select the view, changing from Galaxy Scan (showing the whole galaxy) to Long Range Scan (showing 8x8 sectors) to Sector Scan (all systems and starports of a sector) to System Scan (the star and its planets) to Visual Scan (direct view of a planet, starport or space station with its statistics).

While travelling through space, you may encounter ships. The game then switches to turn-based tactical combat -- but that may include peaceful interaction. In each turn, you first have a selection of communication strategies -- bargain, plead, ask, demand, even impersonate a deity are possible. Then you can move and rotate your ship, and finally, you can fire. Some situations, for example when you're boarding an enemy ship or while travelling on land, you can engage in squad combat, which closely resembles spaceship combat, but is influenced gravity, atmosphere and terrain.

One some missions, you will have to explore underground complexes, which may contains traps and other specials events. There are 17 missions all in all, but they have no time limit, so you can do other things -- and you should, like trying to get some cash. Additionally, some missions are randomly generated, so each game differs somewhat. Character get training after each completed mission, but they can also pay for it, which is very expensive.</desc>

		<desc>Year is 2189, humanity has visited numerous galaxies due to the hyper-space engines. In search of adventure and exotics of the distant lands you have signed contract for 5 years with the Intergalactic Company to work on the Space Lines. For your first trip you were appointed as technician trainee on the freighter AMPELOS. The freighter left Achernar VI in direction of Tau Ceti II. Some hours later you were in the room of piloting when suddenly all alarms start... What is that? You have only 8 hours to discover it.

You start to explore the freighter AMPELOS. Robots became uncontrollable and attack you. They are surely behind the commander's death. Happily, the computer can help you to deactivate them. But your adventure is only beginning and already the cap of the dead commander (peace to his soul) reveal a number, which you remembers quickly.

The gameplay flows as the icon-based first-person adventure. You may move in available directions and do the actions via set of  icons, which are "Take", "Put", "Look at", "Examine", "Use", and some new such as "Listen", "Recharge" (a battery, a weapon). Another icon allows you to start a dialogue, for example, with the navigator or the doctor. You can then ask them simple questions from predefined words such as "HOW TO DEACTIVATE ROBOTS?" and you'll hear the words pronounced. At the right side of the screen you'll see the objects in your possessions and useful information: health, fatigue, your ammunition, your reservation of air (if you are wearing a combine suit). When you arrive in a place, you should use the icon to look at the place (the eye), sometimes several times to discover objects. Then (and before taking the object) you should use the magnifier on the object, because it can't be used on the object already put in inventory. 

Amstrad CPC version of the game is port of Atari ST version and use only 4 colours.</desc>

		<desc>Star Virgins about as obscure as it comes, its a promotional hour long straight to video film from Japan. That was made to promote a little seen videogame of the same name distributed by Activision that only ever appeared on the long forgotten msx system.

Plays out pretty much like a bonkers live action anime movie. Its a camp science fiction fantasy comedy about a girl whose secretly the lone fighter of justice Star Virgin, its her pursuit to stop the planet being attacked from robotic &amp; puppet monsters, giant spiders and whatever else would warrant as being an end of level boss in an 80s video game... at least I think thats the overall idea, because its obviously never been translated into English its hard to totally fathom out what the hells going on, but hey thats the beauty of the Japanese movies right.

Star Virgin herself is every Japanorama fanboys wetdream, shes a cute pink power ranger with her own spacecraft &amp; powerbike and she kicks ass with a bazooka. The whole thing would have made an awesome music video for The Flaming Lips - Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots (what I'm oddly playing while writing this). Sure its none essential throwaway stuff, but its a fun hour even without knowing what they're saying.

[Personal Reasons For Remembering]
Really loved the spacecraft scenes complete with their robotic butler drivers and its not every day I get to see a movie featuring a robotic Statue of Liberty and an evil genius who lives on a floating volcanic island.</desc>

You navigate and warp to fight enemies from the map screen, which tells you the difficulty of the enemies. Fuchsia dots have the easiest enemies and red icons the hardest. Once you clear all enemies from the map, you move to the next level. There are 12 levels in total, and you can even start from the last level if you so wish from the start screen, no passwords needed.</desc>

		<desc>In the 12th century, the Emperor Hui Zhong is faced with an internal rebellion led by Imperial Minister Gao Qiu. The Song Dynasty comes to an end, and Gao Qiu became the new ruler. You take the role of an exiled ruler, and you must build your stats up to be able to challenge- and destroy- Gao Qiu and restore Hui Zhong to the throne.

The game is a military strategy game, like most of Koei's games, but instead of conquering a country, the goal is to depose the despotic ruler of China. You start out lowly, and have to work your way up by conquering smaller prefectures, forming alliances, and fighting small battles. You have to earn the right to attack Gao Qiu's home prefecture, though- he is off limits until you are powerful.</desc>

You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

The player must battle their way through his four guards in a series of best two-out-of-three games of Columns in order to face off against Surhand and bring peace back to the land.

The Flash Mode also returns to this version as well as the new Endless Mode where the main objective is to score as many points as possible before the timer runs out.  There are also special columns throughout these modes such as Glitter Columns which eliminates all blocks of the same color on the screen at once as well as Stone Block Columns which can only be eliminated through magic power-ups that can be obtained by eliminating the base blocks.</desc>

The computer versions also feature an editor.
The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction.</desc>

The game also kept the innovation from the arcade games of the two-player mode and brought in 15 stages for simultaneous action.

The game keeps the typical gameplay of the Lode Runner series. Players have to collect all the gold on the stage, while either avoiding or trapping the robotic guards who are constantly giving them chase. The game also features a level editor so players can create their own stages to play on.

A few months after this game was released, Super Lode Runner II was released which is similar to this game, only it included different stages from the arcade games. Also, this game shouldn't be confused with the MSX game with the same title. While in a similar situation as this game, it contains an entirely different set of stages to play.</desc>

You control Mr. Do, a clown, and guide him trough a field with varying elevation levels, with balls placed on it. You must collect those balls to replenish your weapon, a ball that you throw at your enemies. A trail (shown as a line) follows you while moving around. The area you moved turns gray and will be uncovered. All the balls in that gray area turn into cherries. And, if you do the same with the cherries, they will be upgraded to oranges. The oranges can be upgraded to lemons and finally the lemons upgraded to pineapples. Hidden under the field is a letter (in the shape of a coin), which can be used for the "EXTRA" at the top of the screen. When any of the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" are collected an army of enemies that follows you show up and one of those enemies holds the letter that you touched.
To obtain the letter you must kill that enemy. Now you can collect the other letters. When you obtained all the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" you will receive a bonus.
On the field are logs, which can be unleashed by walking next to the side that is propped up. The log rolls down and kills all enemies it rolls over. But be careful! It can kill you too! To continue to the next round, you can kill all enemies or collect all the balls or fruits.</desc>

The game is a big maze where you need to find objects, primary amongst them seem to be bottles of different colours. The game is laggy, in particular when wielding your weapon. Enemies in the first couple of screens don't seem to do you any real harm. You can kill them typically with a single hit, and you can even walk over them. Killing enemies gives you experience (EXP), and when your experience bar is full your life bar increases (H.P). After a few screens though the enemies suddenly get a lot tougher and can kill you almost immediately.</desc>

You pilot a Battletech-style robot capable of switching from a mech into a jet at any time. Your weapon auto-aims, but uses up a fixed amount of rechargeable energy; if you run out of this energy, you'll have to wait a few seconds before you can fire again. Your mech also contains a shield that can be activated to protect you from harm, but this lasts for a few seconds and uses up some of your life energy.</desc>

		<desc>Time Pilot is an arcade style shooter. Piloting your trusty spaceship, you need to destroy the squadrons of enemy craft that are attacking! On each level you have a quota of enemies that need to be destroyed. After fulfilling your quota, a final boss of the level will appear; when destroyed, you will move on to the next level. The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed you advance in time. In 1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes, but as the levels advance so does the technology. Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus points.</desc>

		<name>Topple Zip</name>
		<desc>Topple Zip is a vertically scrolling shooter that is marketed as a racing game. The basic premise is that you control an aircraft and fly in competition against several other, computer controlled crafts. In addition to shooting at your opponents, you may ram into them, and they into you. Doing so may dislodge a pill shaped power-up from them which you can then shoot and collect. 

Power-ups exist in various types, including defensive and offensive such as giving you better weapons. There are eight different levels, each of which contain a number of warps which link to other levels. How the levels connect is random each time you play the game. 

The goal of the game is to locate a key which is necessary to access the warp which leads to the eight and final level. Collect it from whichever level it is hidden inside of, and access the eighth level before any of your competitors.</desc>

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The Famicom version loses the hammer throw and the high jump, but the NES version restores the high jump while adding skeet shooting, the triple jump and archery as events. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If the player wants to go to the next event or round then they will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

		<desc>After the defeat of the evil wizard Mondain and his mistress Minax in the previous two Ultimas, peace has returned to the land of Sorsaria. Times passes and eventually geological disruptions and a resurgence of the monster populace occur, and it is soon learned that Mondain and Minax had conceived a child named Exodus before their death. Now that child has become an adult with the power to avenge the death of his parents. Obviously, it falls upon the hero from Earth to find and stop him. The third title in the Ultima series was the first to feature a party of adventurers instead of a single player character. The party is created at the beginning of the game by assigning various class combinations and determining the characters' attributes. The game has larger and more detailed towns, populated by NPCs the protagonist can converse with to obtain clues. Like in earlier Ultima games, exploration is divided between top-down overworld locations and first-person 3D dungeons. This installment introduces separate combat screens where player-controlled party fights multiple monsters in a turn-based tile-based system.</desc>

After crashing his ship on Earth while in pursuit of the evil alien Bemular, the super-being Ultraman is here to help whenever the attacking aliens prove too much for humanity alone to handle. Standing hundreds of feet tall with incredible strength and amazing abilities, he can only remain on Earth for a few minutes, and so must defeat his foes before his power drains completely.

Based on the popular television show from 1967, Ultraman directly follows the story of its source material. Cast in the role of the titular Ultraman, the player must defeat many of the same monsters that appeared in the original series. Taking the appearance of a 1-on-1 fighting game, Ultraman can punch, kick, and grapple his opponent, as well as use a variety of various special moves that must be charged. However, in order to actually defeat his opponent, Ultraman must deplete their continually-recharging life bar, and at that moment hit with his most powerful special attack: the Specium Beam. As the game continues, different enemies may even find ways to avoid this most formidable attack, and Ultraman must adapt... Each stage has a time limit of only three minutes, and there are three lives and no continues.</desc>

		<desc>The Mad Overlord Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power, only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis, the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process.

The first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with Ultima and Might &amp; Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre.

The player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.</desc>

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

The Recon mode is a port of the arcade game Xevious; the Scramble mode can be considered its sequel, adding sixteen new stages, enemies, and boss battles, as the brave fighter pilots continue to defend the Earth against its former inhabitants, who migrated to the planet Xevious thousands of years ago and are now determined to re-capture their ancestral homeland.

The game's Scramble mode allows the player to control three other aircrafts in addition to the seris' trademark Solvalou, each possessing unique weapons. These aircrafts include Solgrado (armed with spread shot), Zeodalley (twin back fire), and Gampmission, a large ship that is also a combination of the previous three, with massive firepower and enhanced lock-on abilities. A specific aircraft can be assigned to each of the player's "lives". The amount of points needed to gather an extra life increases if the player selects more powerful ships. Also, enemies become progressively harder as the controlled aircraft collects power-ups.</desc>

		<desc>Yellow Submarine is a variant of the submarine game, one of the oldest versions of which is the Atari 2600 game Air-Sea Battle(1977). The premise is that the player, as captain on a submarine, must shoot at mine-releasing surface ships and sub-hunting planes, all the while avoiding enemy submarines and their torpedoes. The key to playing the game correctly is to properly time the missiles/torpedoes, as well as taking their trajectory into account.</desc>

		<desc>Yie Ar Kung-Fu 2: The Emperor Yie-Gah is a sequel to the MSX / Famicom (NES) version of Yie Ar Kung-Fu, rather than the versions directly based on the arcade release. The game follows the quest of Lee Young, the main character from the previous game, to become a kung-fu master. This involves fighting with a wide range of opponents in a traditional one-on-one 2D environment. Lee Young has a wide range of attack moves he can use to lower his opponent's life bar, including traditional punching and kicking attacks as well as jumping ones. Opponents are well equipped with unique weapons and attacks.</desc>

		<desc>Zanax EX is an enhanced version of the vertically scrolling shooter Zanac A.I.. While preserving the locations and the gameplay system of the original version, this release builds upon the graphical enhancements of the Famicom/NES version of Zanac A.I..

The backgrounds are noticeably more detailed than in the original version; also, some locations have different graphical design. The scrolling is also smoother than in the previous releases, effectively altering the feeling of control and gameplay speed. The status bar, which has occupied the right side of the screen in the original release, has been moved to the top of the screen, occupying significantly less space.</desc>

		<desc>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up. The game has three stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are three distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>

		<desc>Zenji is an action/strategy game where you control a rolling face throughout a maze. Each section of the maze can be rotated by the face. The goal is to turn the entire maze green by connecting each section of the maze to the source at the center of the screen. After all sections of the maze have been connected, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to having a time limit to complete your task, you need to avoid the flames and sparks which wander about the maze. From time to time a number will appear in a maze section and count down from 9 to 0. If you touch the number before it disappears, bonus points are earned. As the levels progress, the mazes become larger, trickier and more flames will appear.</desc>

		<desc>Zoom 909 (ã‚ºãƒ¼ãƒ 909) is an arcade game developed by Sega for VCO Object arcade hardware. It was released worldwide in 1982, however, after obtaining a license for Buck Rogers, western versions of the game became known as Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom. Both Zoom 909 and Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom are largely the same game minus some minor graphical differences.

Though most home ports of the game are based on Planet of Zoom, Zoom 909 was brought to the Japanese MSX in 1983 and SG-1000 in 1985. These versions take more liberties with the formula, introducing a top-down stage as level 3.</desc>
