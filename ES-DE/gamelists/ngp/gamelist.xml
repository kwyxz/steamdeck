		<name>Samurai Shodown!</name>
		<desc>Samurai Shodown! Pocket is essentially a "portable" version of Samurai Shodown 4. Like the other fighting games on the Neo Geo Pocket, the characters are drawn in Super Deformed chibi style (big heads and tiny bodies). This title was also one of the first games for the Neo Geo Pocket, so the game was only in black and white... The gameplay of Samurai Shodown is quite well adapted in the pocket version, but it is not as enjoyable as the Neo Geo classic. The gameplay is very simplified in this version. The characters keep most of their special moves and moves, but the deep strategies of the arcade are almost gone. It's basically a new game that, while not spectacular, is fun.</desc>
