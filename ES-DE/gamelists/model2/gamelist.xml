		<name>Fighting Vipers</name>
		<desc>City of Armstone, year unknown. The mayor has decided to organise a fighting tournament, with the grand finale to be held on top of the city tower. The Vipers, young urban warriors, decide to fight each other, each with their own goal in mind. The eight Vipers come from different backgrounds, such as hard rocker Raxel, the orphan who longs to meet his father Bahn, former gang leader Tokyo, catwalk queen Grace, the giant with an unknown past Sanman, construction worker and former marine apprentice Jane, aspiring fashion designer Candy and skateboarder Picky, not to mention Mahler, who has a score to settle with the mayor.
Fighting Vipers featured a wall surrounding the battle area and equipping each fighter with two-piece armour that can only be broken by powerful blows. Once the armour is destroyed, the unlucky fighter is more vulnerable to the opponent's blows, and damage can also be collected after hitting the wall or the ground after a throw.</desc>

Although it has some serious issues with driving and collision physics, if you stick with the game long enough to overcome its intricacies, it can be pretty rewarding. Like Jaleco's other Model 2 racer, Super GT 24h, you'll want to use an automatic transmission.</desc>

		<desc>Sega Touring Car Championship is a Sega Model 2C CRX arcade racing game developed by Sega AM5 in 1996. It is similar to Sega Rally Championship in design, but uses touring cars instead of rally cars. Unlike Sega Rally Championship, Sega Touring Car Championship has never seen a sequel, and it considered a far less successful game for a variety of reasons, most notably the steep difficulty curve and often awkward car handing.</desc>

		<name>Sonic Championship</name>
		<desc>Sonic Championship is a 3D fighting game, featuring characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The background story is that Doctor Eggman built the Death Egg II, a new version of his facility that appeared in previous games. Stopping him requires Chaos Emeralds, and various individuals including heroes like Sonic the Hedgehog and Miles "Tails" Prower participate in a fighting tournament to gather them. In total there are eight playable characters (nine in later console releases) and two bosses (Metal Sonic and Doctor Eggman).
Gameplay is mostly typical for a versus fighter, it is a one-on-one fight on a best two out of three basis. Players use jumps, punches, kicks and special weapons. Bean the Dynamite for example, a duck-like character who makes his debut in the Sonic universe, uses bombs. Blocking is done by making use of a limited supply of barriers. The whole action is illustrated in a comical fashion though, like one would expect from a Sonic game.</desc>

		<name>Virtua Fighter 2</name>
		<desc>Virtua Fighter 2 is a fighting game developed by Sega. It is the sequel to Virtua Fighter and the second game in the Virtua Fighter series. It was created by the Sega's Yu Suzuki-headed AM2 and was released in the arcade in 1994. VF2 was known for breakthrough graphics at the time. It used Sega's Model 2 arcade hardware to run the game at 60 frames per second at a high resolution with no slowdown.

The arena size could be adjusted up to a very small platform or all the way to 82 meters, which in the genre is considered very large; this is the only game in the seriesâ€”other than Virtua Fighter Remixâ€”that could have such size adjustments. The physical energy meter could also be adjusted to infinity as well, giving you the advantage when beating opponents in the game or practicing moves against the computer player. Incidentally, players discovered that adjusting the arena to a smaller size and giving the characters infinite health could lead to mock sumo matches, wherein victory is achieved by knocking the other player out of the ring.</desc>
