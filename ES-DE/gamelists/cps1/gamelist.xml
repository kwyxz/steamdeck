Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a boss character unique to that round.</desc>

The player can use a sword, an axe, or magic, and can also rescue and recruit potential allies from different character classes, each with their own special abilities. Three years earlier, Capcom had released the similar Black Tiger in 1987.

Magic Sword is set in a nameless world threatened by the dark lord Drokmar, who is in control of an evil crystal known as the "Black Orb" that would allow him to rule the world. To prevent this from happening, the Brave Hero must climb to the top of the 50-story tower that Drokmar resides in, known as the Dragon Keep. After Drokmar is defeated, the player has the option of two endings: destroy the Black Orb, or take control of it and become the new Dark Lord.</desc>

		<name>Muscle Bomber Duo : Ultimate Team Battle</name>
		<desc>Professional wrestling experienced a sudden increase in popularity during the early 1980s, where many professional wrestling organizations were started all over the world. A severe rivalry existed among the organizations.

In order to resolve this conflict, 8 organizations combined to form the Capcom Professional Wrestling Association (CPWA), led by Victor Ortega, the CPWA?s first champion.

One day, Ortega suddenly vanished. He was considered to be the axis of the sport and his unexpected disappearance caused the CPWA to enter an age of confusion and disorder. The BPWA, a dark underground wrestling organization, chose to take advantage of this opportunity and began moving. With "Fighters of Muscle Bomber = Destiny" as the theme, the CPWA chief executives decided to hold a world tour called the ?Crash Carnival,? to decide the new king of the CPWA.

The gong that determines the new ?Master of Muscle Bomber? is sounded?</desc>

A number of power-ups also appear at regular intervals to aid Nemo in his quest through seven tough stages.</desc>

On the beginner level, players can only use the Mexican character.

Another notable difference is in the game's use of backdrops: instead of the world landmarks of the first two games, Pang! 3 features classical works of art in the form of paintings and sculptures.</desc>

The difference to Puyo Puyo is that the blocks do not disappear once a certain number of same coloured ones are connected, but instead there are star blocks which also come in the same colours as the normal blocks. To make blocks disappear the player has to form a connected group of same coloured blocks that contain two star blocks. As soon as the 2nd star block is added the affected group goes away and any blocks that were on top of parts of this group will fall down.</desc>

The speed of the game has been greatly increased (hence the Turbo on the console port of the game); and new special moves are available to certain characters, making combat much more strategic.</desc>
