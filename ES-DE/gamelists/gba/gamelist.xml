		<desc>In Aggressive Inline the player takes the role of one of nine real-life skaters with one specific goal: receiving as much points as possible by performing spectacular stunts. Every of the 13 courses also has various special challenges, e.g. collecting or smashing certain items, which need to be performed to beat it. In contrast to the open areas of the console versions this one features more linear levels and tight time limits. 

It also replaces the "juice meter" with the so-called "grind meter" which is filled up by performing stunts. Every grind decreases this meter and if it is empty no grinds can be performed at all. Of course grinds are an elemental move to beat the challenges. 
There is also a freestyle playing mode where the player can unlock new skaters.

Set in the late 18th century, Napoleon's story is told in Fire Emblem fashion via strategic maps and character dialogue.

The objectives for the missions vary slightly, but the basic idea is to send out units, defeat the enemy and take over the opponent's stronghold.</desc>

		<desc>Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them. The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin. Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible. Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.

To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection. Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.</desc>

		<name>bit Generations : Boundish</name>
		<desc>bit Generations: Boundish is a Game Boy Advance video game released in July of 2006. It was released as part of the bit Generations games, and was only released in Japan. The game can be easily compared to the game Pong, though it features many gameplay differences, graphical enhancements (despite the graphics themselves being deliberately primitive), and sounds.

In the game, you'll take control of two paddles, each moving when the other one does. The goal is to keep the ball within the playing field. Allowing it to exit will result in a gameover. In all, there are five stages, each one containing different concepts though having the basic overall objective. For example, in the Wild Go Round you'll control a ball on a moving record. Because the record is moving, it'll alter the direction of the ball at pivotal moments, which will require the player to be quick on his feet and act appropriately. In all, the game's modes include Pool Flower, Box Juggling, Power Slide, Human League, and Wild Go Round. For players who wish to play multiplayer they can link with another Game Boy Advance with just a single cartridge. In multiplayer, all of the stages excluding Box Juggling are available for play.</desc>

		<desc>bit Generations: Coloris is a Game Boy Advance video game that was released exclusively in Japan. It was part of the second series of bit Generations video games, and is simply just a basic puzzle video game. In the game, you'll be required to place three similarly colored tiles next to each other in order to rid of them. However, unlike most games like this, you don't swap the tiles but rather start to change the color of the tile by pressing on them with the cursor.

Each step of the game the cursor will be one of the three colors that are in play. If there's a red, blue and purple tile, then clicking on a blue tile with a red cursor won't automatically turn it into that color but will rather turn it purple. By continually pressing that tile with a red cursor, however, will eventually change it into a red tile. As you progress through the game, and there will be more than just three different colors, ranking up the difficultly level.</desc>

The game is set in the same fictional world as the original Black/Matrix game, though hundreds of years prior. Three divisions of humankind share the same world - white-winged people who are called angels, black-winged people who are called devils, and wingless people. Those who have wings have great powers and pay little mind to the wingless ones. The angels rule the world via a religious organization called the Prodevon Church, which ensures both the cooperation and ignorance of the wingless people.</desc>

		<name>Bubble Bobble : Old &amp; New</name>
		<desc>No one has ever been able to say just why Bubble Bobble is so much fun, but its mixture of cute baby dinosaurs, candy, and bubbles should give those new to the game an idea. Battle your way through over 100 levels of frantic bubble mayhem. Capture your enemies in bubbles then pop them with your spiky back to clear each stage. Find your way to the bottom of the 100-level cave and save a damsel in distress. Fortunately, if you've never experienced the glee for yourself, all of those elements are back in force in Bubble Bobble Old &amp; New for Game Boy Advance. The game closely follows the original Bubble Bobble arcade classic, but splices together two gaming generations while employing the same graphics and gameplay structure as the original. It also took inspiration from the sequel, Rainbow Islands released in 1989.</desc>

The player has at his disposal all the key abilities of the cat-lady as seen in the movie, and must traverse levels full of platforms and "bad guys", and climbing walls, occasionally.

The game opens with a tutorial mission and then switches to a series of images resembling comic-strips that explain how Patience Phillips became Catwoman. The player then goes through the 24 levels of the game mostly jumping, climbing and sometimes fighting.

The look of the graphics aims toward a comic-book feel instead of the more realistic looking 3D of the console and PC versions.</desc>

		<desc>Bomberman was a robot in a bomb making factory who longed for his freedom. Rumors circulated that escaping to the surface would allow the robot to become human. Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.

The first of the Bomberman series. Bomberman is a single player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, you only have a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (4 directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up.. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</desc>

		<name>Comix Zone</name>
		<desc>Sketch Turner was a starving comic book artist, living with his pet rat Roadkill... that is until a lightning storm mysteriously brought his cartoon villain, Mortus, to life and imprisoned Sketch within the pages of his own comic book. Now trapped in the world that he himself created, but someone else is now drawing, Sketch must battle through the pages of his own comic book, and past his own creations, to a final battle with Mortus. Perhaps one of his own creations, General Alissa Cyan might be able to help...

Comix Zone is a side-scrolling fighting game with a difference, you're inside of a comic book and you yourself know it. Smash enemies into the sides of frames, rip through the paper to unleash a super move and otherwise wreck havoc throughout the limitations of the graphic novel. Sketch himself can jump, attack and use various items that he finds along the comic book, including his rat friend, Roadkill. Button combinations can be used to unleash powerful techniques.

The game progresses linear through each page of the comic book, however secret paths and alternate routes through the story can be discovered. At the end of each level, Sketch receives a super hero rating for how well he's progressing.</desc>

Only singleplayer is available, and no story at all. The main game modes are Grand Prix, two modes based on checkpoints (alone or against opponents), and Last Man Standing where the last one drops after each lap. Grand Prix consists of three classes based on different speed, with three cups each, and and extra cup. Controls allow for speeding up, braking, using items to hinder your opponents (mines, nails, boxing gloves...), and there is a button to drift through the corners. Record times can be saved on the Battery Backed RAM.</desc>

		<desc>Released in conjunction with a 3D update of the classic arcade game on consoles, the Game Boy Advance version is also an update of the original, but retains its side-scrolling gameplay.

The cartridge includes several variants of the game. The main mode is called "XGP". Its basics are the same as in the original: The player's spaceship flies left or right over a scrolling landscape that wraps around after a few screens. The goal is destroy all invading aliens before they can capture the humans sitting on the ground. Besides updated graphics with various backgrounds and sprites for the enemies and humans, there are other differences as well: players can select from different ships, all with slightly different weapons and ratings for shields and speed. The XGP mode offers six different levels to complete. It can also be played by two players over the System Link.

The cartridge also includes "Classic" mode, which is a port of the original arcade game. Finally, "XG" mode is the same gameplay-wise as Classic, but has been updated with graphics similar to the XGP mode.</desc>

		<desc>Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.

The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.</desc>

After having single-handedly saved Mars from demonic threat, you return to Earth, only to find out that the demons have already invaded it, killed all its inhabitants or turned them into demons. It's your task to kill all the demons and to save the Earth.

Doom II looks and plays very similarly to its predecessor, utilizing the same 3D graphical engine with 2D sprites for enemies. The gameplay once again consists entirely of navigating the hero from first-person view through 3D environments and shooting at the demons while attempting to find your way out by flipping switches and looking for keys. Unlike in Doom, which is divided into three episodes, the 30 levels of Doom II (plus the 2 secret levels) form one long episode. 

You have the same weapons as in the first Doom, plus a new one: a super shotgun. There are also some new demons in this sequel, such as the chaingun-toting Heavy Weapon Dudes, the skeletal Revenants who launch homing missiles and the Arch-Viles who have a highly damaging fire attack. There is also one new power-up, a Megasphere which boosts your health and armor to the max.</desc>

The player can choose from Droopy, Dripple, Butch, Bubbles, Vavoom, MC Wolf, and Screwy Squirrel. Each game can be played on a background that ranges like a jail, outside of an Old West saloon, and the North Pole with varying terrain like grass, clay, and ice. Games can be played in a two-player mode over a single cart and even up to four players with the support of a Game Boy Advance link cable. It will even support the Game Boy Advance's downloadable link for players without requiring a copy of the game. One of the best ways to play this game is in the arcade mode. This mode lets players use special impressive attacks when they build up their powers. The character called 'Vavoom' can set in motion a flirty ball that will dodge and sidestep swings. Droopy can blast off three balls of terror at once for players to panic over and attempt to retrieve them. In general, Butch has the most strength while Screwy possesses extraordinary athletic abilities. This arcade style game is a fun way to participate in an entertaining game with classic characters many already know and love. DROOPY'S TENNIS OPEN is sure to draw new fans of the classic cartoon characters as they are just as endearing and entertaining as they have always been in their cartoon shorts.</desc>

		<path>./Dynasty Warriors Advance (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Dynasty Warriors Advance</name>
		<desc>Dynasty Warriors Advance is a Game Boy Advance adaptation of the Dynasty Warriors franchise. Based on the "Three Kingdoms period" of ancient China,  it takes place at the end of the Han Dynasty during 190 A.D. As the previous government collapses, warlords rise up and fight among one another, eventually establishing three powerful kingdoms: Wei, Wu and Shu. Generals from each of these nations spend the next 100 years fighting among one another, each trying to become the dominant power.

Dynasty Warriors Advance is a top-down turn-based strategy board game, but with a focus on action combat. Since it is based on the earlier Dynasty Warriors titles, many of the same concepts carry over. Players begin by choosing one of three available characters from the lands of either Wu, Shu or Wei. Each character has their own unique storyline and missions. A briefing is given for each mission detailing specific objectives before allowing the player to equip themselves with weapons and skills at the camp. Once begun, the player moves the designed number of spaces (determined by movement) around the "board". If an enemy player is encountered, the game shifts to a top-down action fighting mode. Here the player uses one button to attack, another button to charge and another to unleash a misou special attack once it is powered up. Misou energy is charged by successful attacking enemy units. The player's success against the enemy unit will determine the unit's "heath" and will be destroyed completely if all of it's units are destroyed. Some enemy units contain not just soldiers but enemy generals who have their own special moves and greater health. Many missions feature specific objectives rather than just defeating all enemies.</desc>

		<desc>Ecks vs. Sever is the amongst the first FPSes to be featured on the Game Boy Advance. The game tells the story of Ecks, an ex-FBI Agent whose orders are to hunt down the beautiful assassin named Sever. As the cat-and-mouse-hunt progresses, both agents will find out that they are mere pawns in a larger government conspiracy...

In the Single Player mode, the player can choose wether he wants to play as Ecks or Sever. The choice makes a radical difference in the single-player campaign. As Ecks, your orders are to chase Sever, whilst as Sever, you have to evade him. The levels for both characters tend to be the same, but with different objectives, and different locations for both characters. 

As an example, the orders of Sever are to hunt down and kill a government agent whilst as Ecks, your orders are to prevent the assassination. During this level, both characters will encounter each other. As Ecks, you'll have to try and snipe Sever whilst evading her grenades. When you play this level as Sever, you'll have to throw grenades at Ecks, whilst avoiding his sniper fire.

The game also has a multi-player mode for up to 4 players with three different modes, which are Deathmatch (Every man for himself), Assassination (one player is the assassin who has to hunt down the VIP who's being protected by bodyguards) and Bomb kit (Try to gather all parts of a bomb before the other players do).</desc>

Centering around three kids with the same name, MIS-EDVENTURES follows Ed, Edd, and Eddy through yet another of their zany adventures. Gamers will control all three kids throughout the game, switching between them at any point. Each of the three had their own special abilities, and players will need to master each character to get through the puzzle-filled levels. Ed is the powerhouse of the team, able to pick up large objects and move them out of the way. Edd can operate machinery and can make use of different items. Eddy has stealth abilities and is the only character who can use stink bombs to get enemies out of the way. Each of the three also has an unique team-up move that involved all three characters working together. The levels contain the typical insanity often found in the cartoon. On one level, for example, players have to try to sell a number of snow cones from their snow cone stand; however, to get the business going, players have to steal ice from other characters. There are several different scams to complete, each of which involves Ed, Edd, and Eddy making use of whatever they can find or steal. Gamers who love ED, EDD, N EDDY will love stepping into the characters' shoes with ED EDD N EDDY: MIS-EDVENTURES.</desc>

		<desc>One of the Game Boy Advance's launch titles from Majesco (alongside Boxing Fever and Iridion 3D), F-14 Tomcat is essentially a port of Absolute Entertainment's 1994 SNES game Turn and Burn: No-Fly Zone. The game content is exactly the same, but it features a multiplayer mode between other systems (if they have a copy of the game and the GBA Link Cable, of course) and a brand new storyline: the player controls a F-14 pilot chosen by the US government to be assigned in the theater of operations of a war between the republics of China and Taiwan to protect America's "interests" in the region.

The game includes, apart from the previously mentioned multiplayer mode, a landing practice mode, like Turn and Burn. It was later implemented in Majesco's two following GBA flight sims, 2004's Super Hornet F/A-18F and 2007's F24 Stealth Fighter, which re-used this game's engine, with the option of selecting between a landing carrier or a landing strip.</desc>

If memory becomes full or link cable connection cannot be done, the game can generate a password for the track; when it is input on any F-Zero Climax cartridge, the password will generate the track instantly.</desc>

Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.

The first of the Bomberman series. Bomberman is a single player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, you only have a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (4 directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up.. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</desc>

There is also a second game variation called "balloon trip" where you need to collect as many balloons as possible while avoiding the ocean floor and lightnings that form maze-like walls.</desc>

		<name>Fantastic 4</name>
		<desc>This game is a licensee of the 2005 movie "Fantastic 4". Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay. Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka "Doctor Doom" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials. To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.</desc>

		<desc>EA Sports takes players back to the field with FIFA SOCCER 06 for the Game Boy Advance. Featuring nearly ever soccer team in existence and hundred of players, plus tweaks in game play and several new additions. Gamers will first notice the slight changes in controlling their teams. The passing and dribbling controls have been fine-tuned, allowing gamers to control nearly every aspect of the game. Each player has a strength rating that comes into effect when passing, as does the amount of weight players put behind the kick. A new shooting method, called the Optimized Shot Meter, requires more control and attention, as well. All of these realistic details make gamers feel like they're actually in the game and in control of everything. Manager mode now requires players to keep their club's budgets and handle purchases. Players have to decide how much to spend on staff, recruiting, stadium expenses, and other items. Then gamers have to decide if they want to sign with a sponsor to bring in extra income. All of this adds up to create a game that requires managers to really manage their team. FIFA SOCCER 06 contains all of the modes that made the previous FIFA SOCCER games great, including season, tournament, shoot-out, and verses modes. Soccer fans will enjoy playing against all of today's best soccer clubs throughout the season as they recruit, train, and guide their team to victory in FIFA SOCCER 06.</desc>

FIFA 2003 is the tenth game in the FIFA series and the seventh to be produced in 3D. A number of new features were added to improve upon the previous version. Club Championship Mode was introduced with the feature of playing against 17 of Europe's top clubs in their own stadiums and the fans singing their unique chants and songs. A TV-style broadcast package gives highlights at half-time and full-time, as well as comprehensive analysis. One of the most anticipated new features was EA Sport's "Freestyle Control" which allows the user to flick the ball on and lay it off to team mates. Other additions include greater likenesses of some of the more well-known players such as Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho, as well as realistic player responses.

The European cover features Roberto Carlos, Ryan Giggs, and Edgar Davids, representing Brazil, Manchester United and Juventus respectively. In the United States, Landon Donovan appeared in Roberto Carlos' place.</desc>

It's also possible to create all kinds of competitions. The Career mode was also extended, allowing now up to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to turn the tide of a simulated match anytime. This mode is a "light" managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players and increase the clubs abilities in trainers, medical staff and other club staff).</desc>

		<desc>Fire Emblem: Fūin no Tsurugi is the sixth entry in the Fire Emblem series, the first title produced for the system, and the first title to appear on a handheld console. It is a turn-based tactical role-playing game in which players move a small group of units around a square-based grid, battling their enemies in order to complete a certain predefined objective. It is reminiscent of other tactical RPGs with features such as character classes and the ability to level up.

The Binding Blade is set on the fictional continent of Elibe, which has been dominated by humans for centuries following an ancient war between humanity and dragons. The story follows Roy, a young nobleman from the small independent nation of Pherae as he leads a growing army against the forces of King Zephiel of the kingdom of Bern, who is gradually taking over Elibe with the aid of a mysterious power.</desc>

		<name>Fortress</name>
		<desc>Fortress is a Tetris-variant puzzle game. As in that classic game, geometric pieces fall from the top of the screen and must be arranged in lines. Only instead of eliminating lines, the objective this time is to add them to the screen. The game starts with a timer (that counts a moment where neither player attack) and a castle gate falling between two flags (the opponent's flags can be seen to the left of the screen). Once placed, the remaining pieces are used to build a castle around it, as every 2x3 grid of pieces transforms into its walls. A grid of 8x3 pieces transforms into a wizard's tower that can summon a creature to attack the enemy castle. 

Certain special blocks add features to the building: a cannon block places a shooting cannon that starts to attack automatically the opponent's fortress. A block with a window adds one to the building. Repairing peons come out of it to help fix the damage to the castle's walls. A block with a bomb adds a cannon that fires a peon towards the opponent's castle (an aiming reticule is shown over the enemy castle to help choose the right spot). Building walls around these special blocks prevent their destruction from the enemy attack. A monster appears randomly at the bottom of the screen to attack both players.

The player's goal at each level is to reach a number of score points before the opponent. The pieces can be maneuvered with the digital pad, and pressing UP on it makes them fall fast downwards. They can be rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise with the A and B buttons, respectively. Holding the R trigger allows the player to move the screen with the digital pad (for a full view of battle scene). When pressed, the L trigger destroys the top 3 rows of your castle and decreases the score.

The game has three game modes: tournament, battle and blitz. They vary in the amount of seconds on the timer and the goal score. There are four themes: pre-historic, medieval, pirate and space.</desc>

		<name>Island Xtreme Stunts</name>
		<desc>Island Xtreme Stunts is a mixture of different genres in a single game. The player explores a LEGO-based environment in an open world format: ride a skateboard, drive, fly and pilot a range of vehicles all whilst performing stunts and tricks while taking on the bad guy, Brickster. The player is cast as Pepper Roni, a lead stuntman in a big movie production set on LEGO Island.

Even though the player is free to go wherever he wants, there is a story behind the game divided over 25 missions. All the missions are stunt-based. Running around the world in 3rd-person view, the controls are pretty basic and do not offer the trick combinations of other stunt/trick-based games. It is easy to pick up and play, even for the younger players, without worrying too much about what button combination will do what trick. Instead the player can focus on the missions by only having to complete basic tricks with a few button presses.</desc>

Try your hand at plotting out all of the details of the creation and management of a dinosaur park in JURASSIC PARK III: Park Builder. A strategy-simulation title of the highest caliber, the game leaves you in charge of 100 dinosaur species you have the task of placing them and maintaining their health. Of course, there's also the matter of the restaurants, shops, rides, and other attractions. If the park you create is too boring, poorly maintained, or excessively expensive, no one will show up, so you'd better use some seriously discerning judgment. In addition to managing the park, you'll have to pick up DNA strands from throughout the park to create new dinosaurs to keep the people coming back. Does it sound like too much to handle? Just wait until one of your prehistoric pals escapes on opening day.</desc>

K-1 Pocket Grand Prix 2 is a Japan only sequel in which you can select from a roster of 17 famous K-1 fighters from different regions and compete to win the grand prix tournament.
You can also create a fighter and select a region and selection of punches and kicks for him.
The game represents the fighters as over top cartoony sprites in the same style as puzzle fighter does for street fighter characters.
The game plays out in sped up 3 minute rounds and does not represent accurate K-1 fighting as fighters can utilize special moves such as flaming kicks.
The game borrows features from other 2D fighters such as street fighter allowing you to do charge attacks, parries, super moves and you win the game by depleting your opponents health bar.
The game is a little tongue in cheek, when cro-cop wins a fight he does his winning pose in his famous cop uniform.</desc>

Well, Kelly Slater takes you around the world on his boat to surf some of the more famous beaches. With a control scheme similar to all the other Activision O2 brand games, it's easy to jump into the game and surf. 

PS2, XB, and GC description, further below is the GBA description.

Game Play Modes:
Infinite Time - With no clock, no objectives, and nobody around, this gives you the best opportunity to just enjoy the surf. 

High Score - With 3 minutes, how high of a score can you get?

Icon Challenge - See how many icons you can collect and how high of a score you can get before time runs out.

Career Mode - Select a surfer and journey around the world to surf the best waves on the best beaches. As you progress you will unlock new beaches, new surf boards, and new tricks which will be usable in all the other modes of play.

Multiplayer Modes:
Push - Two players surf simultaneously in an attempt to "push" the split screen towards their opponent's half of the screen. As you score points the screen gets pushed more. The winner is decided once one player is pushed from the screen.

Head to Head - Similar to Push but the screen is stationary and the winner is the person with the highest points when the time runs out.

Time Attack - Players take turns to achieve the most points possible. The more points you get the less time is alloted to your opponent.

The Pros in the game: Kelly Slater, Lisa Andersen, Tom Carroll, Tom Curren, Nathan Fletcher, Donavon Frankenreiter, Bruce Irons, Rob Machado, Kalani Robb, and some other secret characters.

The beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Antarctica, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren's Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways.

The PS2 version of the game also includes a playable demo of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4

GBA description

Surf Modes:
Championship - Compete against 8 other surfers. You progress by surfing in 12 stages, 3 heats per stage. Your surf score is tallied from each heat and the top 3 surfers of the stage get to move on.

Challenge - Pick a surfer and do challenges around the world.

Drop In - Instant action surfing - go and just surf.

Multiplayer - With a Link Cable and another copy of the game you and a friend can link up to compete against each other.

The Pros are the same as above.

The beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Waimea Bay, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren's Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways.</desc>

		<desc>Aiming and moving in cover and blind-fire modes is tricky, though. To gain the 3-D effect, some detail gets sacrificed. Usually this is no problem, but occasionally you'll have a tough time recognizing an object. You move from area to area to engage a new group of enemies. You'll conveniently find crates for cover and barrels to help you pull off big explosions. Locking the enemy in your crosshairs, signified by your crosshairs turning red, doesn't guarantee a direct hit? The accuracy depends on the weapon of choice. A shotgun will normally provide a kill on the first shot. If you have an automatic rifle, your shots are relatively inaccurate even if your aim is true.</desc>

In Europe, it is known as King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie. Due to the limited technology the Game Boy Advance has, King Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World is very different from the home console versions of the game. In this game, players switch between various roles - one being the movie exhibition visiting Skull Island to do filming which comprises actress Ann Darrow, director Carl Denham and scriptwriter Jack Driscoll, and the 25 ft gorilla and king of Skull Island, King Kong. While the overhead human section focuses on puzzle-solving and adventuring elements, Kong sections are combat-oriented side-scrollers.</desc>

		<desc>Kururin Paradise is the sequel to the GBA launch title, Kuru Kuru Kururin. In this game, Kururin and his family see an advertisement for the circus, which takes place at 6:00. Kururin's family arrive there on time, but Kururin is late, and when he gets there, everybody is missing! It's up to Kururin to search across the land for his missing family using his faithful helicopter, the Heririn. As in the first game, Kururin must navigate his way through fairly narrow mazes, trying not to hit the walls. Three consecutive hits, and the Heririn is destroyed, and you must start the stage again.

Paradise is vastly improved from the original game. It is now possible to find hidden keys in the levels, which open up locked doors, allowing for branched paths in the world map. Certain paths also lead to boss encounters, which take the form of an addictive mini-game including, but not limited to, lawn mowing, gathering stars, flying Kururin himself through clouds, and hopping across a path dodging helicopter blades. If you beat the boss, these mini-games are then added to your mini-game library, where you can play them against up to three friends using only one cart.

The game also features twelve toys built in that can be accessed by selecting one from a menu, then turning your GBA off, then on again. Most of them are fairly useless or incomprehensible in Japanese, but there are a couple of interesting ones, like the love tester, the musical note player, and the memory match game.</desc>

		<name>Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie (and first three books of the series), Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events for Game Boy Advance puts players in the unfortunate shoes of the incredibly unlucky Baudelaire orphans: Violet, Klaus, and Sunny.

Each orphan has an unusual talent that will let them progress through three chapters (each with over a dozen levels). Though the game looks like a traditional side-scroller, combat takes a backseat to clever puzzle-solving and adventure game elements. The three orphans must use their talents, along with items found in the world, and various interactions to escape each level and avoid the evil Count Olaf and his elaborate plans to inherit the children's fortune.

Inventions also take a big role in this game, and players will have to assemble them from common household objects. For example, in one level, Violet will be hunting for ice cream scoopers, soup cans, and a crank to invent an "apple chucker" which can help defeat Count Olaf's friends.

The game offers quite a bit of replayability, too, with quest points and exotic books earned for discovering all the game's quirky secrets.</desc>

		<desc>Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, were kidnapped by the alien Tomator, the evil Croutonian ruler, who is collecting unique life forms to display in his gallery. The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.

The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.

The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.</desc>

		<name>Mario Party Advance</name>
		<desc>The first portable incarnation of the Mario Party series, Mario Party Advance shakes things up quite a bit on the GBA.  With the focus on the single-player, there are all kinds of single-player mini-games, one giant single-player board to traverse instead of multiple ones (Shroom City), and all kinds of different Gaddgets and gameplay modes to indulge in.

The main single-player experience involves traveling across "Shroom City," which is a major departure from the standard set-up in past Mario Party titles.  You have the choice to be Mario, Luigi, Peach, or Yoshi, and depending on who you choose, you'll start at a different spot on the board, which is quite large.

You're given die rolls to navigate the board and, when you reach special sections of the map, complete special quests, which often involve helping residents of Shroom City and/or participating in special challenges.  Most quests involve collecting some sort of object elsewhere or a mini-game.  By completing these quests, you'll collect stars, which eventually allow for special boss bouts with Bowser, and you'll unlock mini-games and Gaddgets, which are simple, toy-like contraptions that you can play with.

The game ends when you complete your allotted number of turns, although additional turns and die rolls can be earned during the game by completing the "Mushroom Challenges" that occur rather often.  After completing your session, your rewards are saved, and you can play with your mini-games and Gaddgets in Play Mode.

There are also two additional modes available, "Party Land," where you can play special duel mini-games with a friend, and "Challenge Land," where you play through special modes that test your mini-game skills to earn coins, which can be used to purchase additional unlockables in a shop.

Finally, there is also a feature called the "Bonus Board."  You can play with a board that is included with the game using the GBA.  The GBA takes care of die rolls, mini-games, and end-of-the-game events.</desc>

Mario is also transformed into a ball and chases after her.

There are 5 levels, each consisting of a set of pinball tables. Each table has some exits (including the one below the flippers) that Mario can use to move to other tables. Also, each one holds a star, normally obtained by defeating all enemies on the table. Some exits require that Mario has a certain number of stars. To gain access to Bowser's castle, Mario must defeat the bosses of the first 4 levels, which gives him star keys. The game also features a "Time Attack" mode, which allows players to fight already defeated bosses again.</desc>

The game plays out something like Final Fight, where the player walks from left to right with the ability to move on the z-axis and punch and kick wave after wave of enemies including the occasional boss.

It has some unique elements added to the genre basics, however.  A meter controls the use of super powers, which can be upgraded as experience is gained. Players also have the ability to summon various Marvel heroes for quick support roles.  There are many items to find, both quest items, such as keys to unlock doors and weapons and equipment, like weapons and armor, to buff up the characters' abilties.</desc>

		<desc>The ancient gods have passed judgment, and as a result all of mankind has been sentenced to be replaced with a new, less sinful race. The only chance for redemption lies withing a magical item that will allow mankind to atone for its sins. But the item in question has been stolen by the enemies of humanity, and the verdict of the gods will soon come to pass.

Mazes of Fate is a fantasy medieval first person "dungeon-crawler" RPG in which you create a character based on gender, class and attributes (or take your pick from one of the three pre-made characters) and set out in a quest to save the human race from oblivion. The game alternates between world and town map sequences in which you control your party from an overhead perspective and visit shops and get quests from NPCs and the many dungeons that compose the bulk of the game itself. While dungeon crawling the game switches to a first-person perspective from which you control your party as it fights all the monsters that cross your path and loot the treasures uncovered. Combat is real-time although the game pauses while you navigate action menus.

Features loads of items, weapons and quests, as well as tons of monsters and up to 5 recruit-able party members.</desc>

Take control of your favorite character and face off against many opponents as you make your way to the head of the GP to reach the ultimate prize, an incredibly rare battle chip!

Gameplay is based around the Mega Man Battle Network series of games, in that players purchase and use various battle chips to combat their opponents.  However, unlike the main games, players do not have direct control over their Net Navi.  Instead, players pre-select their battle chips, and one of these chips are used in the battle against the opponent.  Once selected, the game automatically plays out the battle.

There is also a process called 'slotting in', which can be performed by pressing L or R during battle when your slot in gauge is full.  Slotting in allows you to use an additional battle chip during gameplay to assist you.  If successful, the chip will be used, and aid you with healing, dealing extra damage, and so on.</desc>

The legendary heroes of the Reploids, X and Zero, defeated the evil Sigma long ago, and a new army was created to prevent outbreaks of the Maverick Virus. But as time went on, the army became oppressive, and began to deal out a paranoid brand of justice. It is said that their leader, once a great warrior, has become cold and calculating, eliminating any Reploid that dares oppose him.

A hero is needed in these dark times, and that is exactly what Ciel and her rebel group have found in an old ruin...a hero from the past, reborn in the future.

Zero has come into a time he does not know, to save it from a figure of the past...the fate of freedom rests on his shoulders.</desc>

In addition to the old Cyber Elf system, this game also contains a new "chip" system, where Zero can gain new abilities by finding chips and installing chip in himself. But they didn't decide to abandon the Cyber Elves in this game by giving them nothing new. No, in order to extend the life of the Cyber Elves, they added the new concept of "Cyber Space" to levels, where you enter a door to Cyber Space and are allowed to use each Cyber Elf as much as you please without them dying. However, there aren't too many "Secret Disks" (items that can contain anything from profiles of characters to Cyber Elves to new chips) in Cyber Space, so it's better to spend more time in the normal level.</desc>

In order to do this, the gang must complete various party games while travelling along the game board. Players take turns to role the dice and move their character. Certain parts of the board will open up mini-games, which must be completed to move on, and the winner is the one with the most magical power stars, which are gained by landing on blue spaces on the board.

There are four boards, each with their own theme based on an amusement park ride. Up to four players can play using the one console, or play with four consoles to challenge each other in a set of mini-games.</desc>

Monster House is an action-adventure game developed by Artificial Mind and Movement and published by THQ. The game is based on the film of the same name.

Although the game was marketed toward the same pre-teen audience as the accompanying film, its gameplay was highly reminiscent of Resident Evil 4; the game was generally higher-quality than many other games based on children's films, and it received high ratings from numerous prominent gaming magazines and websites, including Play magazine and GameZone.

Monster House was met with mixed reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Game Boy Advance version 66.50% and 69/100, the GameCube version 65.13% and 60/100,  the DS version 63.65% and 62/100 and the PlayStation 2 version 60.64% and 59/100.</desc>

		<name>Monster Rancher Advance</name>
		<desc>Monster Rancher Advance is a monster raising sim that allows players to raise and customize 440 monster types. These monsters can then be tested in in-game tournaments, or battled against other players in 2P mode with the GBA link cable. 

Monsters are created in the game's shrine through the entry of letters, numbers and punctuation symbols. Players begin with the ability to enter up to 4 characters to make monsters, and can unlock the ability to use up to 8 characters through gaining higher trainer ranks. Different words or combinations of characters can not only make different types of monsters, but each monster can have varying attributes and characteristics, making each one unique.

Players then train the monsters by choosing  which foods to feed, which drills to do to raise attributes, what training to send them to for new attacks, and what items to give them. The game starts with a modest amount of money with which food and items can be purchased, more money is earned in tournaments. Gameplay revolves around planning training sessions, adding new attacks and juggling a bank account, along with attempting to win tournaments. As monsters age, they can be added to a coaching staff to help raise new monsters to better attributes, or they can be combined with other monsters to make stronger babies. Monsters do not die in this game, however, they do face an enforced retirement age.

There is a fairly straightforward storyline, where some characters from older Monster Rancher games visit, and new characters are introduced. The gameplay itself, like most other Monster Rancher games, is open-ended and has unlimited replay value.

The 2 Player mode, involving a link cable and two copies of the game, allows players to test the monsters they have raised against other players. The 2P mode also allows players to trade items and cash with one another, to wager items or cash on tournaments, and trade raised monsters into each others' games.</desc>

		<name>Moorhen 3 - The Chicken Chase!</name>
		<desc>This really couldn't be any simpler; Moorhen features no complicated gameplay whatsoever. You just shoot things. The real skill though is in knowing just what to shoot and when to shoot it and where some targets reap sizeable rewards others will drain your score in no time at all. One addition to version three is the introduction of protected birds flying around with your intended targets which means that shooting now takes a little more thought than simply blasting into the sky. Other features remain intact and there are still items that need to be avoided such as balloons and various animals on the ground. As usual though you'll need to experiment to find out just what's worth hitting and what's not.

One of the best parts of the Moorhen series has been the hidden bonuses and secrets but they've always been well concealed and you're more likely to discover them by accident rather than actually work them out. I won't spoil some of the goodies we've discovered in this version but Moorhuhn 2 featured spiders that could be spun around trees and the first edition had you shaking trees then shooting down ten leaves for a 100 point bonus. Finally the hi-score chart is still there as is the wonderful battery back up so you can prove that you did actually get a score over 50.</desc>

		<desc>The Nowhere Islands are an idyllic place; the residents of Tazmily Village live peacefully and in harmony with nature and with each other. But this changes when the mysterious Pigmask Army arrives and proceeds to destroy and corrupt, with force and sly persuasion alike. The main character is Lucas, a young boy who must find out who wants to destroy the tranquility of Nowhere Islands and turn them into a high-tech nightmare. 

Mother 3 is a top-down role-playing game. The player character (the characters controlled by the player change often) travels around the Nowhere Islands with his party, talking to people and furthering the plot. It is possible to "dash", which not only allows to travel faster, but also allows to knock weaker enemies out of the way (or to ram some objects/characters). 

There are many enemies to battle in the game. The battles are turn-based; each turn, a character can attack with his weapon, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic abilities, others have different special skills), use an item or try to run away. The battles feature a musical combo system, where tapping a button in rhythm with the background music will cause additional damage to the enemy. The characters have "rolling HP meters"; when they are dealt damage, they don't lose all the HP right away, but their HP decreases slowly; this way, even if a character receives massive damage, he can survive with only minor injuries if you manage to end the combat quickly. Winning battles gives the characters experience (and thus makes them stronger) and, later in the game, money (known as "DP"), which can be used in shops to buy better equipment or useful objects. 

There are many frogs encountered throughout the game, who serve as save points (and later as ATM machines). If all characters die during a battle, you can come back to life near the latest save point encountered and try again.</desc>

There are a number of different modes: Grand Prix (GP), Motocross, and Traffic. GP takes place at a number of different locations across the world on paved tracks in places such as San Francisco and Russia. The paved tracks require the player to learn how to effectively use their brakes around corners. The GP courses contain small differences between them, giving more variety to the courses in the game. Motocross requires the player to drive on off-road terrain and to master the act of "powersliding" on corners. The courses found in Motocross races are less hospitable and often take place in arid and unkept locales and with obstacles. Traffic mixes both GP and Motocross, having mixed pavement courses and traffic on roads that serve as obstacles.</desc>

To do this, you will need to drill down several thousands of feet avoiding being crushed and remembering to pick up air tanks.This is a real-time puzzle game where you will be continually moving down or sideways in an effort to get to the bottom. As you dig, blocks will fall to fill in the spaces below. Like colored blocks will stick together (giving you time to rest), but will disappear if 4 or more blocks come together. This can cause chain reactions (very common in two-color levels) that become dangerous quickly.Three modes of play: Story, Time Attack, and Endless Driller. Story Mode uses the bare bones story from above. Time Attack gives you a set levels with a specific time limit. Endless Driller allows you to dig for as long as you can.</desc>

		<name>NFL Blitz 20-02</name>
		<desc>NFL Blitz 20-02 is a game based on the American Football sport. As the whole series, it takes away most rules and tactics (leaving 36 offensive and 18 defensive plays) while focusing on an action oriented approach. Because of the limited control scheme of the system, the options on the field are less in comparison to the main console version: besides the usual movement, passing and player moving commands, the player also may tackle, leap or activate a turbo boost. The playing perspective is an angled pseudo-3D view with the goals at the top/low side of the screen.

Both in the exhibition and season mode (17 weeks), the game offers the choice between 32 teams with different statistics regarding passing, defensive and line. The mini games, which can be also selected from the main menu, are basically practice modes for field goal and goal-line situations as well as a NFL trivia quiz.</desc>

With the console versions having migrated to 3D graphics years earlier, the handheld game retains a 2D top-down view very similar to the earliest titles in the series on the Genesis and SNES.

Besides a standard mode for exhibition games, the game has a practice mode where the number of players on the field can be freely chosen. Season mode is unusual in that, unlike in other games, the player doesn't select a team to lead through a season. Instead, the game includes the full game schedule of the 2001-2002 NHL season, and any team in any scheduled game can be played. If no games of interest are scheduled on a given day, it can be skipped and the results simulated. The season mode also includes the ability to trade players, sign free agents and even to create players.

The game also includes a multi player mode over the link cable, with up to four players able to join for cooperative or competitive play.</desc>

The story in the game follows the movie pretty well and it is well presented through in-game and comic dialog style cinematics. It's about a Grizzly bear named Boog who is very happy with his domesticated home. But one day he gets in trouble with his new friend Elliot and the town's authority decides to put them back in the woods where they belong. Unfortunately, for them, the hunting season has just begun and Boog has no idea how to survive outside of his garage home with his beloved caretaker, Beth. 

The game begins just before Boog and Elliot are dropped in the woods. You control Boog and he has many cool moves. He can jump, roll, grab and throw forest animals as well as roar. The goal of the game is to protect the forest animals from the hunters. The forest is full of hunters and boss hunters in each animal territory. It is your job to clean up the forest so play it wild and rally an army of forest critters in a hilarious quest to scare off the hunters!</desc>

		<name>Oriental Blue - Ao No Tengai</name>
		<desc>The game continues the tradition of Tengai Makyou series, also known as "Far East of Eden". You play as either Tenran or Aoi, a teenage boy and girl, respectively, on quest to defeat the ancient evil that threatens the prosperous land of Jipang, to prove themselves worthy of the legendary Fire Clan, warriors who have been protecting Jipang for many generations from evil demons and warlocks. The land Jipang is very similar to medieval Japan, and during your adventure you'll also visit Mongolia, China, and other Asian countries.

The most important new feature of the game is a non-linear storyline. You can tackle many missions in any order you want, and the storyline also changes depending on the outcome of major battles. If you lose against a boss enemy, the game is not over, but instead, a branching storyline path is revealed. Otherwise, the gameplay is similar to other Tengai Makyou games, featuring overworld map traveling and first person perspective, turn-based combat.</desc>

1. Pac-Man: The original arcade classic, complete and un-cut. 
2. Pac-Mania: A conversion of the 1987 update to Pac-Man, which takes the elements of the original arcade game and puts it into an isometric view, as well as adding the ability to jump.
3. Pac-Man Arrangement: Never re-produced outside of the arcade, Arrangement again uses the elements of the original Pac-Man and adds a fifth ghost, who can change shape and size when combined with the other 4 ghosts, and make life harder for Pac-Man. New power-ups are also included, like the ability to dash quickly around the screen, warp points to get from one place to the other and new ways of catching ghosts.
Pac-Attack: Like Tetris before it, you must fit falling blocks together to complete a line to clear the screen. In this case, the falling tiles also have ghosts in them, and once the Pac-Man tile appears (a tile with the Pac-Man symbol), Pac-Man will eat all of the ghosts that are in his path until he gets to a dead end.</desc>

He still faces opposition, however, from ghostly nemeses like Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde. He must also run, jump, and swim his way past other malevolent creatures, such as skeletons, spiders, and killer fish. Thankfully, Pac-Man has a variety of attack methods. Excluding ghosts, most baddies are susceptible to projectile "Pac-Dots," the "Ultra Butt-Bounce" (which also helps him jump higher), or the "Rev Roll," a speed burst allowing Pac-Man to make lengthy jumps off ramps. When disposing of ghosts though, he must first ingest a good old-fashioned Power Pellet, then devour them before its effects wear off.</desc>

In response to this, the great Wizard Pac created a potion that turned 5 ordinary fruit into the "Golden Fruit." A young knight called Sir Pac-alot fought and sealed Spooky underneath a large tree using the Golden Fruit, which were attached to the branches of the tree. In the present time late at night, Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde sneak into the village and, in their mischief, pick the Golden Fruit off the tree in the center of town. Unfortunately, this has released Spooky from his prison. Spooky tells the ghosts to take the Golden Fruit and follow him if they wish to rid the land of the Pac-people forever. When Pac-Man awakes, he hears the news from Professor Pac about the Golden Fruit and Spooky, and sets off to defeat the ghosts and Spooky.</desc>

Pinobee can walk along the ground or shimmy up walls, but his main means of locomotion is dashing through the air. As he makes it deeper in his quest, Pinobee gains the ability to dash farther and farther through the air. Soon enough, he's spending more time hovering and dashing through the sky than on the ground. This unique play control system gives Pinobee a fresh feel.</desc>

		<name>Qwak</name>
		<desc>In this game, you play a duck and the object of the game is to get the highest score without losing all your lives. This can be achieved by getting all the fruit and gems in the level, or killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to complete and once you complete all of them, the levels are repeated. 

You exit each level by collecting all the gold keys then entering through the door that opens. You have a certain amount of time to complete the level before spikes fall down the level. There are eight areas, all consisting of ten levels. At the end of each area, there is a guardian waiting for you, and again, you have a certain amount of time to defeat them.

You kill enemies by throwing orange-colored eggs at them, and in the earlier levels, they go down in one or two shots, but in later levels, you'll find out that all of them take more than two shots to bring down, so your orange balls would be useless here. The solution is to get a special power-up that will give you chocolate eggs.

Besides gold keys, you can also collect silver keys. This lets you unlock a gate, giving you access to more shots or power-ups. There are also booby traps in the level, such as spikes, and some parts of a level are blocked off by spikes. Get a mushroom and they turn into flowers that you can pick up. Beware, getting another mushroom will make them turn into spikes again. 

Apart from the normal levels, there are challenges where you have to complete a level and get all the fruit as you can under a 20-second time limit. Depending on gameplay, there are  also tricks where the last key you have to get flies away and you have to catch it. Other tricks include turning on the lights to see enemies, and running away from the "happy ghost". You'll receive bonus points at the end of the level if you manage to collect every gem in the level.

Qwak can be played as either a one or two player game. The game was released at budget price, and later on a CD double pack with Alien Breed '92.</desc>

		<name>R-Type III : The Third Lightning</name>
		<desc>R-Type III was originally released only on the Super Famicom/SNES, but later ported to the Game Boy Advance. It was the first game in the series to introduce new Forces. As well as the original Force (which was now named the Round Force, later named as the Standard Force in R-Type Delta), the player could choose from two other Forces: the Shadow Force and the Cyclone Force. These both had new, different weapon sets and special enhancements.

It also refined the weapons and charging system. It reverted to the original Red-Blue-Yellow weapon system, and the Diffusion Wave Cannon from R-Type II was replaced with a more standard wave cannon. Charging this cannon to full beam strength results in a massive, powerful beam that passes through all enemies and obstacles. A new weapon called the Hyper Wave Cannon was also added to the ship, which the player could use instead of the normal wave cannon if desired. By switching to Hyper mode and supercharging the wave cannon, the ship temporarily gains the ability to use the Hyper Wave Cannon, which is unique among wave cannons in having a rapid fire capability. The shots fired create damaging explosions, and if the player has collected one or two Bits, they spin around the ship burning with energy. However, this Hyper mode causes the ship to overheat after a short while, and it must subsequently spend seconds cooling down, during which time the wave cannon is inoperative.

The fighter in R-Type III is identified in R-Type Final as the R-9Ø Ragnarök; it was originally referred to as 'R-90'. In fact, the original R-90 has been split into three in Final: the R-9S Strike Bomber has the R-90's basic Standard force unit and first wave cannon, identified as Mega Wave Cannon. Final's version of the R-90 has the Shadow Force and Hyper Wave Cannon, but is unable to choose its Force or switch between Wave Cannons. Finally, the R-9Ø2 Ragnarok II has the R-90's final Force, the Cyclone Force, and the Giga Wave Cannon, which can be charged through 7 loops. It can be assumed that this is because the original R-90 would simply be too powerful for the game to be any kind of challenge.</desc>

		<name>Racing Gears Advance</name>
		<desc>This handheld racing game offers a range of licensed cars, several courses and circuits, and a challenging set of opponents. To these stock elements, it adds one more: weaponry. Now you can choose to nitro past the opponent ahead of you, or slow him down with a missile.

With each vehicle and driver pair you can race in Practice Mode to familiarize yourself with tracks or choose a Championship Mode to progress through a series of circuits. After each race you'll need to spend some of the money you've earned (either by placing or picking up money icons during the race) to repair and -- if possible -- upgrade your car. The upgrades can improve your car as a racing machine (e.g. a larger engine or better brakes) or as a war machine (e.g. adding more weapons bays or buying a new type of weapon).

The track design uses the isometric view, and almost never puts the car behind an obstacle. However, among the twisty roads are a few shortcuts that require you to think outside the lines of the road, and occasionally take a leap of faith.</desc>

As with Wario Ware, the game is actually a series of shorter games bundled into one package.  Before each game starts, you are presented with a short tutorial that gets you ready and practice before you begin the real thing.  Control is normally very simple - usually, only the A Button is required, but some games make players press multiple buttons for different actions.

Players will punch in time with a karate expert as pots and rocks are thrown; pluck hairs off of an onion; march in time to an instructor; hit a baseball while the screen zooms in and out; shoot ghosts with arrows; chop demons as a samurai; and much more.  At the end of each set of stages is a 'remix stage' - in this stage, sections of the previously played stages are combined and thrown at you at random, all while a single song plays.</desc>

		<desc>Over the years, toy fads come and go, but the truly great toys are always popular. This is true of ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS, a game that pits a blue robot against a red robot in a boxing match. DSI Games and Full Fat, recognizing the popularity of the toy, has created a Game Boy Advance version of ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS so players no longer need to have their punching robot handy to go a few rounds. The core concept of ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS transfers over to the GBA with no problem. Players select which of the robots they want to control and get into the ring, punching and blocking their way to victory. Gamers can practice, play a quick fight, or enter a tournament to see if they can claim the title of Rock â€˜em Sock â€˜em master. The game also features a two player mode using the Game Boy Advance Link, giving players the chance to battle their friends in much the same way they would play with the toy. This is the real joy of ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS because playing against a friend really captures the feel of the classic robot battling game. Players who enjoy playing with the robot boxing toys will love ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS. The toy translates over to the virtual world very well, and the game perfectly captures the classic feel and look of the toys.</desc>

Set in a more fantastical Sengoku period, it involves a samurai hero or heroine on a journey from south to north of Japan driving away the demons who have taken over the country. While rather basic and repetitive in level design, the game's combat mechanics are well developed. The hero wields three different weapons for combating multiple enemies at once and can equip three different spells, which makes for some hectic boss fights on the end of each chapter.</desc>

		<path>./Shining Force - Resurrection of the Dark Dragon (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Shining Force : Resurrection of the Dark Dragon</name>
		<desc>Shining Force is a turn-based tactical RPG. Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.

In Shining Force, each allied unit is represented by a character with his or her own background and personality, much like in the Fire Emblem series. Although there are no "generic" units, except on the enemy side, most characters contribute little or nothing to the plot upon joining the player army.

Each allied unit also has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A unit can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the character's level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level.

Battle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies' leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player's leader, Max, or if the player chooses to escape the battle by casting Egress. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle's outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the player's army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although Max's death results in the player losing half of their money.</desc>

		<name>Shining Soul II</name>
		<desc>The Dark Dragon was defeated by our hero in the first Shining Soul, and the people rejoiced as the Darkness faded away.  People are quick to forget, however.  As time passed, people's lives improved and they forgot about the Darkness.  But as the Light grew more and more powerful, it upset the balance between Light and Dark and soon Darkness was on the rise once again.

A prophet comes and warns the people of the impending dangers, but no one listens to him.  Although his crystal shows the upcoming dangers, the people pass by without any interest.  An agent of the Darkness, Gillespie, lures this prophet outside the city and kills him and shatters his crystal so the people remain ignorant of what is coming.

This same agent gives the "Forbidden Fruit" to Deatharte, the trusted adviser to King Marcel in Klantol Castle.  The adviser didn't trust Gillespie, but curiosity is a powerful force.

It is now up to another hero to take on the journey to once again stop this growing Darkness.  After choosing your character from 8 possible, you start out on his or her way to a tournament being held at Klantol castle.  On your way, you meet an adventurer who will explain how to battle.  Your journey then takes you to the castle to start the tournament.

This tournament is interrupted when the king finds out his daughter is missing.  The king's adviser heads out to find her, and the king asks that you go as well.  It is here that your story really begins.

The gameplay is similar to most RPGs of this type where the monsters are fought in real-time.  An interesting part of this game is that your resistances will increase when used.  Outside the castle, you can stand on a fire that will not damage your HP, but as your resistance reacts to the fire, it will increase slowly.  Traps will also increase your resistance if you are hit by them, though you will also be hurt.  Only the one fire is safe.

Take on many monsters, cast spells, get new equipment.  But most of all, save the world from Darkness.</desc>

Sigma Star Saga is a hybrid of the side-scrolling shooter and RPG genres.  Players interact with characters and explore the overworld, and are frequently 'summoned' by random ships for battles.  To successfully complete a battle, the player must defeat a preset amount of enemies, and they gain experience with each enemy defeated.  As players explore the overworld, they can also discover Gun Data, which can be used to customize the player's shot with over 15,000 different weapon combinations using abilities such as rapid fire, vertical shot, and experience gain.</desc>

		<name>Snood</name>
		<desc>Snood is a puzzle game based on a simple idea, of the kind that was commonplace in the late 1980s. The game is set out with a grid of small differently-coloured shapes, each featuring faces drawn on them. A succession of blocks are placed in an aiming device at the bottom of the screen, and you must rotate this so as to aim them, off the walls if necessary, to hit ones of the same colour.

When 3 or more of the same colour make contact, they are removed from the field of play. Any blocks which were only connected to those blocks (and not to any others or the ceiling) get removed from play as well. This is crucial, because each shot that fails to drop any blocks off causes a meter to move on one level. When this reaches the top, the line of blocks drops by one level. Once it reaches the point where blocks are moved down below the playing area, it is Game Over.

There are five skill levels, as well as a set of 50 challenge levels, and a Journey mode in which you play through one level from each difficulty. From medium difficulty upwards, you'll have to contend with Skulls among the layout - these can only be removed by being dropped away.</desc>

		<desc>Sonic Battle is a fast paced pseudo-fighting game akin to Super Smash Bros. Rather than being 3D side-scrolling, the game employs a 3D isometric view that is comprised of actual texture-mapped polygons. The character sprites are 2D.

There are 9 characters to choose from and 5 modes of play: Story, Battle, Challenge, Training, and Mini Games. You can link up 4 GBA's to fight your friends, and each character has several different attacks. It has a system of selecting Aerial, Ground, and Guard based attacks. Depending on what type of attack you set for which area (aerial/ground/guard) you have a possibility of 9 total different special attacks to choose from (only 3 at a time in a match though) which you can change each time you lose 1 stock point.

The game includes a trainable character whose abilities and techniques you can raise and add to. You get to pick and choose every aspect of the robot's style (running, attacking, jumping, dashing, etc.).

The game takes a moderate amount of time to play through as all the characters, and adds a longer lifespan to itself if you wish to play through and beat it completely (all characters, get all moves for the trainable robot, etc).</desc>

Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!

Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.

You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</desc>

		<name>Spy Hunter</name>
		<desc>One of history's best-loved arcade games shrinks down to fit in the palm of your hand. From the distinctive music to the climactic boat transformation, this translation does everything it can to replicate the original coin-op adventure, and loses none of the thrills. Driving the lightning-quick G-6155 Interceptor a vehicle that can switch from car to boat to motorcycle you'll try to destroy the N.O.S.T.R.A. organization before it destroys you. You'll use oil slicks, smoke screens, and missiles to knock your foes off the road, out of the air, and below the surface of the water. This version of SPYHUNTER actually serves as something of an update on the original, as there are seven real-world locales to test your resolve, and the gameplay is now mission based. The graphics have also gotten a bit of an overhaul, with visuals taking place in near 3D. Whether or not you had the pleasure of growing up with this game, there's nothing not to love about one of the original white-knuckle spy games.</desc>

Now, at the command of the elusive Ripto, droves of Rhynocs are pouring into the Dragon Realms in yet another attempt to make life miserable. As Spyro, Agent 9, or Sergeant Byrd, you must help the Professor close the hole quickly before the gate becomes too big and the two realms fuse together--permanently. You can use Spyro's new abilities, including the Head-Butt Slam, Cyclone Attack, Phoenix Vision, and more.</desc>

		<desc>Dragons never seem to have had it too easy. They have always had to worry about dragon slayers, plus they usually get a bad rap for being destructive, and let's not even get started on what people say about their breath! Fortunately Spyro has generally avoided such negative opinions, but then again he hasn't always had it easy either. You'd think that after several death-defying adventures on the Playstation over the past few years, which included the defeat of the evil Sorceress, Spyro and his friends would be able to take some time off and enjoy a bit of a vacation at Dragon Shores. But with evil brewing and a new title on the way for the GameBoy Advance, which is due out in November, the gang shouldn't get too comfortable on the beach.</desc>

		<desc>Spyro Orange is Vicarious Visions' first Spyro the Dragon title, taking the reigns after Digital Eclipse's GBA trilogy. For Spyro's fourth appearance on the Game Boy Advance, the development team has given the dragon a more traditional side-scrolling environment for his overworld instead of taking him back to his isometric exploits. But the scrolling platformer is only part of the experience. Spyro Orange focuses on dozens of mini-challenges for its gameplay, like a vertical shooter where Spyro floats around blasting sheep or collecting gems, a rapid-button-tapping challenge involving tug-o-war and ice cube creation, or driving around in a tank, or knocking out a series of bad guys in a Breakout-style challenge. The game supports link cable play for multiplayer challenges.</desc>

		<name>SSX 3</name>
		<desc>EA Sports returns to the slopes and the insanely fast-paced action of snowboarding with SSX 3 for the GBA. Combining racing with tricks, the game allows players to choose from different events and challenges as they desire. The story mode of SSX 3 involves, like the previous entries in the series, becoming the best snowboarder in the world. Players have a cast of characters to select from, most of whom have appeared in previous SSX games. Once players have selected their character, they're off to the slopes to start winning races and performing huge tricks. The main mode has 12 different events players can participate in. Players select the event they want to compete in from the map. There are races, super pipe, big air, and other events, and there's something for everyone. Winning these events nets the player cash which can be used to upgrade their equipment. In addition to winning the race, players want to look good doing it, and that's where the tricks come in. Pull off enough of them, and the player's boost meter fills, rewarding them with some extra power. Complete enough tricks and the character learns new, even more dangerous and impressive tricks. Gamers who love snowboarding will enjoy SSX 3. While players can't explore as freely as they can in the console version of the game, the racing is still intense, and the many different game play options keep the game from getting boring or repetitive.</desc>

		<name>SSX Tricky</name>
		<desc>SSX Tricky is EA's follow up to SSX. Tricky features far more storytelling than the original through the use of personality attributes. Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC's "It's Tricky" to play. 

Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include "behind-the-scenes" footage and a "making of" segment.</desc>

1. Shooting
2. Archery
3. Javelin
4. Football
5. Pole Vault
6. Hammer Throw

In the Shooting game, you have to shoot down pairs of clay pigeons that are shot in from the side. You view the event from a third person perspective, and have full control of the cross hair. The rest of the events are different. They all use timing meters, one for strength and one for accuracy, where the player has to hit the button at the right spot on the meter. 

Two game modes are available. Practice is the first, where one player can play any of the events at any time, without going through the rest. The second is the tournament where one or two players sharing the same machine can go through all the events. For each event the player will earn points, and there is a high score table for overall scores.</desc>

Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and Juli. Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika.

The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training and Entry. 

World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the home town heroes that you run into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms).

Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter)

Versus - Two human players battle it out. 

Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy.

Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Training).

Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.</desc>

Both were released in the fall of 2001 in Japan, neither have been translated into other languages.

Unlike other areas of the Suikoden franchise, in which the storyline is a major element of gameplay, Card Stories focuses mainly on the card battles themselves and less on the plot.

Most of the cards feature characters who appear in both Suikoden and Suikoden II of Konami's role-playing video game series. Several cards also feature characters who would later go on to appear in Suikoden III.

The GBA game retells the story of Suikoden II with a few changes to how they transpire.</desc>

The aim of the game, as with the previous titles in the series, is to remove a collected number of coloured bubbles from the game screen. To do so, at the bottom of the screen, you aim and fire the coloured bubbles from a launcher, sending the bubbles upwards into the container. Match three or more together of the same colour to clear them from the screen. If you're too slow, the collection of bubbles moves down the screen towards you, and the game will end if it reaches the bottom.

Classic mode features a number of bubble puzzles previously seen in the Bust-A-Move series, while Normal mode has some new variations on the bubble removing theme. Two players can also compete against each other.</desc>

Beneath the lowest row, there you see the new row building up. Once all blocks are present, this row will be now the lowest row, while all others are moving up. Once one block reaches the top of the playfield, you loose.

Each individual level has a preset value of rows, which will build up. To win a level, all you have to do, is to prevent that a full vertical row (from bottom to top) gets stacked up.

The game offers 4 game modes: Traditional, Puzzle, Relapse, and Strategy. Two of them need a brain, while the other two just need a fast hand.

Traditional works like explained above. New rows show automatically, with increasing speed not only from level to level, but also in a level. Means: the level starts slow, but in the end, new rows will complete every second. Power-Ups are available in this game mode.

Relapse works exactly like Traditional, but with one major difference. The action isn't just limited to the bottom of the playfield, in fact, both bottom and top now filling with blocks. Power-Ups used on one side affecting both. How to win is the same, but you loose, when blocks from one side touching the other.

Strategy is one of the two game modes where you must think. Clicking fast will only help to see the Game Over screen. New rows won't appear automatically, instead for each cluster you remove, a full new line will appear. So you have to plan carefully before neutralizing a cluster.

Puzzle is the game mode, where no new lines appear. Also there are no Power-Ups here. But this is the most complex game mode. Your task is to completely remove all blocks, if at least one block is still available, you loose. There is also no time limit, so you can think as long as you want.

The first three game modes offering bonus levels, which works like the Puzzle mode. So, if one block remains, you only scoring the normal points for removed clusters. Only when all blocks are removed, you score the bonus points. There are only two differences: it isn't so complex, and you only have 15 seconds time.

There are 5 different Power-Ups in the game (2 good, 2 bad, 1 depending of the situation): Platform Block (won't move, just blocking the vertical row where it is), Indestructible Block (does move like a regular block, but can't removed with normal actions), Color Bomb (one of each of the 5 colors, will detonate all same colored blocks in it's big radius), Super Bomb (shorter range than the Color Bomb, but blow up all blocks, regardless the color; only way to remove Platform/Indestructible Blocks), and finally, the Gravity Block (only available in Relapse Mode, will shift all blocks from the side where it was activated to the other side).</desc>

Throughout the game's tracks, the player will come across power ups that boosts the speed of the player car and obstacles that hinder it like for example oil which causes the car to spin around. There's four different tracks in the game, each with its own layout and appearance, although the difference between them is very small.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the live action film released in 2004 (which in turn was based on the 1960s series starring marionettes), Thunderbirds stars Alan, Tin-Tin, and Fermat, three children whose guardians are part of the International Rescue team. The player takes control of all three children as they go through training and are then forced to travel around the world to save members of International Rescue from an evil villain known as The Hood.

The game takes place in locales such as the International Rescue island, Africa, and even outer space. Each of the three characters has his or her own unique abilities that the player must use to solve puzzles and advance through a level. Alan has strength and jumping ability, Tin-Tin has telekinetic powers that are used to move objects, and Fermat can hack computers and roll through holes. While the majority of the gameplay is primarily composed of solving puzzles from an overhead view, there are also flight action sequences where the player can fly one of the many vehicles known as the Thunderbirds.</desc>

		<name>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004</name>
		<desc>Tiger Woods is back for another round of golf in the 2004 edition of the "best selling pro golf series".

The biggest addition to this version is EA's Game Face, which lets you customize everything and anything.  You have the basics, such as hair, skin, facial hair and other general appearances, but Game Face allows you to customize every other aspect, from teeth shape, logos, tattoos, headbands, hats, and more.  You may also change individual body mass, muscle tone, mid-section, arms and legs.  You also have the option of choosing specific swing style animations, post-putt and celebration animations, and "pissed off" animations for when you score a triple bogey.

One of the new modes is World Tour, which puts you through a standard 52-week PGA tour to earn money, sponorships, and better gear.  You can play for up to twenty seasons.  The other new game mode is Battle Golf, where you can win an opponent's clubs if you beat them.  All the other standard game modes are here, from Skill Challenge and Speed Golf to a Skins Match or Practice.

A new feature is the game's ability to read your console's internal clock, and provide you with game modes.  If it's near the end of October and your clock is properly set, you may be invited to a Halloween event where you can win items specific to that event.

All top PGA players are included for you to play as (or against), including Vijay Singh and Justin Leonard.  Newcomers to the sport have also been added, such as John Daly.

Most of the courses from 2003 have made it, with seven new courses, both real and fantasy.  One of the new courses is Bethpage Black, an extremely difficult course located in Washington.

Like all other 2004 EA Sports console games, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 has the EA Sports Bio, which tracks your accomplishments and games over all EA Sports titles.  The more EA Sports games you play, and the longer you play them, will increase your EA Gamer Level and unlock additional rewards, such as a new driver in Tiger Woods or historic teams in NHL 2004.  This feature isn't on the PC version.

Gamers who buy the PlayStation 2 version will be able to play online through EA's matchmaking service.  You cannot play online with the Xbox or GameCube versions.

If you buy the GameCube version, you can use the GameBoy Advance to hook up to the GameCube to unlock special rewards not available through normal play.</desc>

Between the long list of well-loved characters and the intense combat design, TINY TOON ADVENTURES: Buster's Bad Dream ranks among the Game Boy Advance elite. Make your way through four unique environments including Acme Forest, Haunted Mansion, Space Station, and a surprise locale partnering up with other Toons to destroy the likes of Elmyra, Montana Max, and many others. Babs Bunny, Dizzy Devil, Buster, and all the rest of the gang appear throughout, and there are plenty of hidden areas and personalities to unlock. The game's team system is such that one player can stun or distract an enemy, opening the door for the other player to inflict serious damage. The relationship between cartoon characters and violence dates back a ways, and TINY TOON ADVENTURES isn't about to break up the love affair.</desc>

Buster Bunny, Plucky Duck, and the rest of the TINY TOONS crew are ready for fun, and you're in the driver's seat. The basic premise of this addicting, original title is to arrange pairs of colored eggs, dropping them onto the screen to create combinations. Of course, there are numerous obstacles and would-be detractors to make things more difficult (UFOs, Tasmanian Devils), and time is never on your side. There are plenty of characters from the animated series along for the adventure including Hampton J. Pig and Fifi La Fume and each is prepared for puzzle-style battle. As many as four players can link up to see who has the quickest reflexes, and there are plenty of single-player modes to keep you busy as well. If you're a TINY TOONS fan, this one is a must-have. If you're not a fan well, you should be.</desc>

It simulates football matches through players taking turns to throw dice for attack and defense moves. Combinations are formed through multiple throws of three blue dice (attack). Further gameplay also involves a white one (more risk through double or nothing), a green one, and a red one (defense). The concept borrows some elements from poker dice with risk assessment based on retaining dice after the first throw. The gameplay involves different types of shots, but also penalties and foul cards (causing a player to wait a turn).</desc>

The turtles have grown apart, and Raphael has taken to crime fighting solo under the guise of the Nightwatcher.  The Foot Clan are turning up in the streets again, and a mysterious man known as Winters seems to be involved with them. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!

The Game Boy Advance version of TMNT can be best described as similar to the NES game River City Ransom.  Players take control of either a specific turtle or the turtle of their choice (depending on the mission), and fight through waves of enemies in a sidescrolling beat-em-up style.  Enemies will drop the usual health pickups, but also drop money and weaponry.  Money can be used to purchase weapons or upgrades between missions, while weapons can be used as a more powerful tool to defeat your foes (however, these weapons have a limited use).  After the completion of a mission, experience is earned, and after a certain amount of experience is gained, you can level up the turtles to improve their fighting statistics.

Each turtle has their own specific weapon: Leonardo with his dual Katana, Michelangelo with his Nunchucks, Donatello with his Bo Staff and Raphael with his two Sai.  These weapons are used in their standard attacks.  A basic attack is performed with the B Button, but you can perform different attacks with B and other buttons such as the directions of the Control Pad and the A Button.  Uppercuts, Sweep Kicks, Jump Kicks and more can be performed, and you can even juggle enemies in the air to get more hits in and increase your score.</desc>

The missions will follow pretty much the same storyline as the original game for PC/GC/PS2/XBOX with the emphasis on being a complete platformer with here and there some first-person sniping job to do.</desc>

The game features some moderate graphical improvements, as well as minor gameplay changes such as the fact that health kits are no longer an inventory item, and the addition of a laser sight to Sam's pistol that allows the player to know exactly where the rounds will strike, even when moving around. Also, Sam can now open doors while carrying a body, shoot while hanging upside down, SWAT turn past doorways unnoticed, and perform a half split jump.</desc>

		<desc>This story takes place in a land ruled by and intended for kids: the Ketchup Kingdom. On the holiday, Tomato Day, King Abiira makes an important announcement, declaring a rebirth of the nation with the help of the six Super Kids, and unveiling an awesome machine, the Super Cara-Cooker.

Unfortunately, just after the machine is unveiled, the TV of a boy named Demiru blows out. The adventure begins when you take control of Demiru, and set out to have your TV repaired..."

Tomato Adventure is a very cute and unique RPG meant for young kids, and is currently only available in Japan. It's fairly simple compared to the more complex RPGs out there. But I still think it's very fun; it reminds me a lot of Super Mario RPG.</desc>

Nintendo DS players will also take Sk8land online through the wi-fi mode, along with touch screen controls. GBA players aren't left behind either, with an updated create-a-park and skater modes and multiplayer to boot.</desc>

		<name>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</name>
		<desc>The Tony Hawk skateboarding series makes its debut on the Game Boy Advance with this adaptation of the second Pro Skater game.

Gameplay is similar to the original console game. The levels have been adapted from the console version for the two dimensional isometric perspective; one is even taken from the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

In Career Mode, choose from one of 13 professional skaters and, in each level, complete various goals like collecting items, performing special tricks and of course breaking high scores by performing tricks and combos. Completing the goals earns money which unlocks new levels and can be spent on new boards, tricks and upgrading your skater's stats. In competition levels, you don't skate for money but compete for a medal.

In the Free Skate and Single Session modes, unlocked levels can be practiced and new high scores be established.</desc>

The line-up of street and vert riders include Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Steve Caballero, Rune Glifberg, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Eric Koston, Chad Muska, Bucky Lasek and Bam Margera from MTV's Jackass (and Tony Hawk, of course).

The create a skater mode returns, allowing for even further levels of options for your character, like adding glasses and tatoos to changing the colour of the knee and elbow pads or even the hair.

And the levels themselves that you must skate through are now more interactive, with cars and humans blocking paths and making noise as you race around to make as many points as possible. Use items around the streets or the park to jump from or over to increase your score, and pull of as many wild and wacky tricks as you can.</desc>

		<name>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</name>
		<desc>THPS4 is the fourth game in Activision's ever popular franchise.

The main feature of this game is it's redesigned career mode.  When beginning a level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, get a feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits.  When you're ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX.  Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this and grind that.  There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo.  Miss a trick, and goal fails.  Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard.

All the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas.

The levels are been expanded and are huge.  Some of the levels include a college campus, a shipyard, and the infamous prison complex Alcatraz.

For multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King Of The Hill.  New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo Mambo.  THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live.

The PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has online play, utilizing either your own network adaptor or the official one.  The PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray's Pro Wakeboarder, which is not featured on any other version of the game.</desc>

There are different cars and courses to choose from, with extensive tuning options based on the gear ratio, steering, brakes, tires, aerodynamic settings and the height handicap. There are also three difficulty levels.</desc>

The game contains exciting tennis gameplay, a number of different modes, and a lot of fun. Career mode, the main mode of the game, has players creating a male or female character from scratch using the game's fairly deep customization mode. Once their player is created and named, gamers move to the court. First comes several training rounds with the coach, who will teach players everything then need to know about controlling their character, serving, and returning the ball in TOP SPIN 2. However, each lesson costs money, so players will need to quickly enter a low-level tournament to earn some cash. Many of the tournaments won't be available at the beginning, but as players win matches and earn rankings, more difficult tournaments will open up. Eventually, players will find themselves facing off against big name tennis stars like Andy Roddick, Venus Williams, Roger Federer, Maria Sharapova, Lindsay Davenport, and Lleyton Hewitt. Gamers can also play quick games as either singles or doubles, play an exhibition match, play three different mini-games in party mode, and take on friends using the Game Boy Advance link. Overall, players who love tennis and the challenge it brings will love TOP SPIN 2.</desc>

Trick Star is a futuristic racing game where the racers ride slick one-wheeled bikes. Players race along the track, with the goal of not only coming first, but also performing stunts to impress the crowds. Stunts cannot be performed until a certain speed is reached, and the "Trick Star" appears on the HUD. When it appears, players can perform a stunt by holding L or R, as well as any direction on the Control Pad. Performing stunts also fills your boost meter - when it is full, you can press L and R simultaneously to get an extra boost.

In League Mode, players must complete three tracks, as well as scoring enough points to qualify for the Challenge Mode. Once the player has enough points, they can enter Challenge Mode, where they are asked to perform a particular set of stunts in between markers. When they succeed, they are rewarded with additional stunts and progress to the next set of tracks.

Trick Star also includes one player at a time multiplayer, for up to four players. Players can compete in Time Trial (aim for the fastest time), Stunts (get the highest stunt point score), Long Jump (jump the longest distance along the track) and Challenges (complete the required challenges). After each player has had a go, the results are shown.</desc>

		<name>Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2 : Bush Rescue</name>
		<desc>The Game Boy Advance rendition of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue is essentially a 2D-ized version of the 3D console design. The GBA title follows the exact story structure of the console platformer, right down to the still screens lifted out of the animated cutscenes. Gameplay-wise, Ty 2 is a traditional platformer that puts heavy emphasis on boomerang action. Players control Ty through huge levels that go all over the map; up, down, left, right... and each location and situation on the handheld is based specifically on the same location and situation in the console. The sprite graphics of Ty and his pals have been rendered from the 3D assets of the console bigger brother to retain a consistent feel throughout the game design. There are elements that are original to the GBA game; character profiles during conversations, for example, are supplied by drawn stills unique to the handheld game.</desc>

		<desc>Pro Beach Soccer is the first game based on the Summer variation of football, played by five players aside on a sandy surface. The game includes 32 national teams (some with their real stars) plus 6 all star teams to be unlocked in 3 game modes (Exhibition, Pro Beach Soccer Tour and Tournament)  played in Bangkok, Rio de Janeiro, Marseille or Venice Beach.

Gameplay is classic arcade, with one button to pass, another to juggle the ball and another to shoot. One of the key aspects is the "State of Grace"; by making fancy moves (such as overhead kicks, heel passes or heading the ball back and forth) and scoring goals, a power bar starts filling, and when it's full, all team attributes are maxed up and the players are given the ability to quickly run with the ball.</desc>

		<name>Ultimate Spider-Man</name>
		<desc>ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN is Activision's third SPIDER-MAN game and the first to be based off the comics rather than the new movies. The GBA game puts players in control of the web-slinging Spider-Man as he does battle with Venom and other enemies while getting help from some familiar superheroes. The story of Spider-Man begins when 15 year old Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider. He soon realizes he has the ability to climb walls and to sense things. Shortly after being bitten, Peter and friend Eddie Brock discover a mysterious black suit that their fathers created before their deaths. Eddie ends up putting on the suit, which turns him into the powerful villain known as Venom. Peter must battle his childhood friend and other villains like the Green Goblin, Carnage, and Electro to save the city. In story mode, players can walk around New York City as much as they wish as they accomplish side-missions or move the plot along. Instead of walking, though, Spider-Man can shoot webs onto tall buildings and swing his way around the city while capturing gang members and stopping crimes. He also must stop Venom's plot and defeat the other villains. Players will also enjoy seeing Spider-Man joined by allies like Wolverine and the Human Torch for some scenes. Fans of the comics will enjoy how ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN draws on the comic style and storyline, while movie fans will like getting to see another chapter in the Spider-Man legacy.</desc>

Battles in the game are played in real time from a top-down perspective, not unlike Zelda. You can attack with your equipped weapons and perform small combos, rushing and charged attacks. When a character runs out of HP, it turns into a ball. Whoever manages to knock the ball into a pit scores a point. While in ball form, characters can roll around and dodge attacks until the normal form is recovered. Succeeding in this, however, cuts a part of the character's life bar, making continued survival more difficult.</desc>

A rider (using a board that's like a combination of a surf board, body board and skateboard) is pulled along the water by rope at high speeds by the boat up front, and must pull of tricks either by jumping of jumps or using the wake left by the boat itself (hence the sports name).

Unleashed takes this sport and turns it upside down, allowing you to fly down water ways through well known locations around the world, pulling stunts off buildings or cliff faces. Other objectives are included that have you completing tasks and busting tricks in a unique way.

Multiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull off the best tricks.</desc>

The Terran Confederation, slowly demobilizing and reorganizing its military assets, has settled on a new strategy: building several Midway-class megacarriers, brainchild of Navy Commodore Christopher Blair. These new carriers, over a kilometer long, carry all the hardware and weaponry of a Kilrathi-War-era carrier battle group. The first one, the Midway herself, is undergoing her shakedown cruise, with Blair along for the ride. Before this, though, the player is treated to a CGI video of a bizarre rupture in space in the Kilrah system: the first of the Nephilim invaders. The game's titular prophecy involves the coming of these alien invaders, who shall arrive only after "one who has the heart of a Kilrathi, but who is not Kilrathi-born," conquers the felinoid warrior race.</desc>

The missions usually come in three flavors: Top-down view bombing missions where you have to take out strategically important targets, isometric strafing runs where you get to blast anything that you fancy blasting with an unlimited supply of ammo, and of course the main part: Dogfights in the sky. Rendered in 3D, seems from behind your head.

The game is set in the years 1916 through 1918, and to loosen things up a little, we get to read a page of our character's new entry for the diary-like journal in his company between every mission.</desc>

You're going to learn that there's nothing more dangerous than a Worm with a bazooka or a shotgun...

At first sight, Worms World Party may seem very similar to Worms Armageddon. However, this time the game has been specially designed with multiplayer in mind. Up to 6 players can battle out at the same time on local networks or on the internet, using Team17 own matchmaking service, called Wormnet.

Other welcomed additions are the Wormpot, which can provide 400 gameplay variations from "Goliath Mode" to "Bleeding Worms", hundreds of new landscapes, flags and fanfares, and a load of single player missions.</desc>

		<name>Worms Blast</name>
		<desc>The gameplay is similar to that of Puzzle Bobble/Bust-A-Move, but with several key differences. There is a hexagonal grid of coloured blocks at the top of the screen, while the player's character sits on a boat floating in water. Unlike Puzzle Bobble, it is able to move side to side. There are multiple weapons that can be used, however the only weapon the player has to start with is a bazooka. As with Worms, holding down the fire button increases the power behind the weapon's launch, affecting how far it will travel. It is possible to fire the bazooka (and some other weapons, such as the grenade and dynamite) in an "arch", allowing players to reach difficult areas.

Shooting blocks will have one of two effects:

If you hit a block that is either the same colour as your bazooka missile, or is a rainbow block, that block and any other same-coloured or rainbow blocks connected to it will be destroyed. Any blocks that are not the same colour will not be affected; however, if the only thing holding those blocks up is the coloured blocks you have just destroyed, those blocks will fall into the water.

If you hit a block that is a different colour from your bazooka missile, or is a "dead block" - an uncoloured, grey block - it will be recoloured to match the missile.

(Weapons are affected differently by other blocks. This is covered further below.)</desc>

Led by the young emperor Gulcasa, who seized control of the Empire in a brutal coup d?etat, Bronchia's Imperial Army cuts a bloody swath through the people of Fantasinia and the Royal Armies of King Ordeene. Amidst the chaos, a young woman escapes from the besieged capital of Partina -- a woman with innocence in her face, and a sword in her hand. The girl?s name is Princess Yggdra, the last surviving member of the royal family; the sword is the Gran Centurio, a legendary blade once wielded by the founder of Fantasinia, and passed down through generations of royalty. Fleeing to to a remote valley at the southern tip of the continent, Yggdra meets up with Milanor, the charismatic leader of a band of thieves, and readies herself for a war of liberation.</desc>

		<desc>Three high school sophomores, Yui (Yui Kashiwabara), who is smart but not good at making friends, Hiro (Hirokazu Mitani), who is physically strong, and Leslie (Leslie Doyle), who has strong psychic abilities, enter a haunted house built deep in the forest where an evil spirit called Kambara rules, and they are trapped.

The house is full of ghosts and cursed items, and the time limit for a living person to remain safe in this dangerous haunted house is roughly 24 hours. In addition, due to the exhaustion of their physical strength, they may run out of power before the time limit is reached.

Time and space are distorted in the mansion, and it is impossible to move around as you wish, but you must somehow find a way to return alive while you still have life left in you.</desc>

		<desc>The Princess has been kidnapped by King Koopa (again) and it's up to Mario and Luigi to save her (again). Not to be confused with the western Super Mario Bros. 2, this sequel to Super Mario Bros. is very much an expansion to the original, with many reused graphics and concepts, though new ones are also present.

Instead of offering a two-player mode as in the original, this game allows you to choose between a Mario mode and a Luigi mode, with each character handling differently. Mario has tighter ground control, while Luigi has greater jumping capabilities.

Power-ups remain the same: Super Mushrooms grow a brother from small to Super size, Fire Flowers give them the ability to throw fireballs at enemies, Starman makes a character temporarily invincible, and a 1-Up Mushroom will give one more life. New to this game is a power-down, a Poison Mushroom which will harm you as if it were an enemy.

The goal is still to survive from the left side of the level to the right, avoiding perils and bopping enemies along the way, progressing through a series of 8 worlds with 4 levels each. That is, unless a warp zone is found allowing areas to be skipped. There are new tricks that work for and against the player, though. Some piranha plants will come out of their pipe even if you're standing right next to them, and bloobers now appear outside of the water. Wind can be present to alter how jumps will behave. Some warp zones will actually take the player to an earlier level instead of to a later one.</desc>
